        I have officially broken the habit. For the first year since the start of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/covid-19">ongoing COVID-19 pandemic</a>, <s>I have found a full and complete ten albums that I was excited to put in this year's write-up</s> my dumbass found <strong>eleven</strong> albums and I didn't realize until I went to number them in my final edits of this post, so fuck it, whatever, here's 11. Thank you for being patient with me and continuing to follow along. As for the highlights of the list, this year we have not one, not two, but three labelmates make it to the list, on some <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Golden_State_Warriors_season">2017 Golden State Warriors</a> shit. We were blessed with regional hip-hop making it back on trend, meaning we might see a new <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast%E2%80%93West_Coast_hip-hop_rivalry">East Coast-West Coast beef</a> with a strong Midwest and South not to be forgotten. Also, as a little treat, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQFQCS-BeRk">I'm doing my part</a> to end century long tribal rivalry; we have two Nigerians who I am allowed to claim when they do well due to the agreements of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_Ghanaian_presidential_election">🇬🇭 Jollof Accords of 1960</a>. Afterall, current geopolitical boundaries in Africa were just created by colonists in an attempt to divide the territories that used to belong to the kingdom of Mali with the goal of conquering them and taking their resources to prolong a global white capitalist supremacist oligarchy anyway.

        <h3>11. "it's not that deep" by Kembe X</h3>
        <p>
          Chicago rapper Kembe X (born Dikembe Caston) has shown up as an incognito feature to TDE signees for the better part of a decade. In Top's own words, he's "<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dangerookipawaa/status/744606566200926208?lang=en">a friend of the family</a>". He's steadily built himself up on the sidelines and really first popped on my radar for his 2019 EP "<a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kembe_x/sets/i-was-depressed-until-i-made">I was Depressed Until I Made This</a>" which didn't quite crack my list that year but was definitely a favorite of mine on release. I started noticing him more for his features with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcH_oMTbq5A">Zacari</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQSaxrDjtk0">Ab-Soul</a>, and most recently collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--VUOZxx40o">Isaiah Rashad</a>. Caston has been biding his time patiently waiting to blow. I'm not convinced this project will be his superstar moment but it also doesn't seem like Kembe X is going anywhere anytime soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this newest project, "it's not the deep", he evolves his style even further while, flirting with more alternative hip-hop, dipping into jazzy improvisational cadences and flows. This leads me to feel like this project is more of a mixtape than an album. I know those two words are interchangeable in the streaming era but to me, an album is a cohesive body of work sonically and/or thematically. This album feels lot more like a mixtape because Kembe X is demonstrating his many musical styles and deliveries in distinct ways on distinct tracks. They don't mesh with each other or really transition into each other. The abruptness is at times jarring but it is so consistent as to be intentional. It feels like he's destined to be a Songwriter with a capital S. Each arrangement makes sense, but when you add in his own technical rapping ability and vocal delivery, you can't help but feeling that having a different voice deliver record it might sprout further critical success.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does tie this album together is his almost conversational rap delivery and his mesmerizing hooks. The album is written autobiographically. Imagine Kembe X is just telling you about his day, his life, and how he handles women, his own emotions, fame, money. There are no gaps worth mentioning with the information he gives you, it's first-hand what else could you possibly want? You aren't going to be left wanting more.
        </p>
        <p>
          On DEATH & TAXXXES, Kembe X, goes hard from the start. "For first I'm one of the greats, had to come out and address it OK" ending each subsequent line with the OK punctuation. He is telling you unfiltered exactly what he thinks about what people thinks of him and how that compares to what he feels about himself. He might know some dangerous folks but that doesn't mean he is always with them. His work ethic keeps him busy and the hook extolls a much more pious side of him with the trancy refrain of "I'm always talk' bout God and money \ I'm always talkin' 'bout money and God" he exclaims that there's no stopping him if he focuses on his two north stars. You got his M.O. plain and simple and everything lyrically he told you about prior flows into that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Caston is having fun. He's pushed himself and challenged himself to make something that he feels confident about and that he loves. He's been told "<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/KEMBE_X/status/1848547629661040799">it's not that deep</a>" for a lot of his life as a way to silence the conversation and he has, in his modern era, resolved to not stay silent and own his own critical analysis.

        <h3>10. BLUE LIPS by ScHoolboy Q</h3>
        <p>
          Quincy Matthew Hanley, better known as ScHoolboy Q, is one artist that has been putting out quality every release but has never quite seemed able to make this list. Obviously, that has changed with the release of BLUE LIPS. This album is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/schoolboy-q-interview-new-album-blue-lips-1234987475/">a long time coming</a>. Some might say <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_Face_LP">Blank Face LP</a> was the first inkling anyone would have gotten that Q was trying to make something more than an album of bangers. Following that, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Talk">CrasH Talk</a> was that dream realized, albeit rushed. BLUE LIPS is all of its predecessors distilled and perfected. The album has the quintessential ScHoolboy Q bangers mixed in with introspective raps, and a lot of different musical styles mixed in, it's the true heir and undisputed successor of all that has come before it. Notably, as a TDE signee and one of the original members of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hippy">Black Hippy</a>, Q ties for the title of second TDE-signee to be present on this list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since he's never been on this list, I'm just gonna give some background on Q that everyone should know. He's a Hoover Street Crip off Figeroa. So when you hear him say FIG SIDEEE you know what he's talking about. 🔷 The stylistic choice in capitalizing the H's likely comes from his Hoover affiliation, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/ScHoolboyQ/status/119574827412619264">amongst other things</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before diving too deeply into the new side of Q, I wanna talk about the old side. Pop is a banger. This is the kind of shit that makes you hit PRs in the gym. Rico Nasty drops an exceptional feature to add to her <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ApJmDC_B9o4?si=RgmFDxrtlwNIb81d&t=109">flawless</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghgp2RnhFrM">feature</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_yI2959DYU">catalog</a>. The only thing about this song that strikes me is that its abrupt ending makes it feel unfinished. Rico was just hitting her stride when the track ends. The hard finish of Pop and its hard electric guitar re-focuses the listener to a softer guitar as the next track starts. That softer guitar doesn't go on for long and the beat switch on THank God 4 me reminds the listener that this is a ScHoolboy Q album and we're back to bangers. The beat has some bass and the lyrics have brags and so many one-liners amongst them: "The Maybach, me and her married", "Big fees one of my features", and (hilariously) "I put gold seats in the house just to pee on". He hits another beat switch with a complementary flow switch to end the song with similar content. This is the kind of shit you listen to a ScHoolboy Q album for.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this is a Q album, the standout star of this album is Devin Malik. A brand new TDE signee and 25 year old producer-turned-rapper he worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpcsssBx2Y0">Isaiah Rashad on The House Is Burning</a> but is making his name known now on BLUE LIPS. He's credited with features on Love Birds and Back n Love where he steals the show dropping gems like "Said 'Fuck the radio', we tryna sound like this \ NBA money, we don't need your Air Jordans \ Washed up aesthetic, we just waiting for the end \ Jesus, forgive 'em for they motherfuckin' sins \ I'm just tryna stay up in the background like ad-libs". When this album dropped, it dropped to a lot of acclaim from folks tangential to Q in the industry, including one other past member of this list. <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/AM1ND1/status/1763618769077706841">Amindi</a> was the first one I saw and I laughed very hard when I did. He's talented as hell and he'll be around for a long time that's for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hesitated the entire time writing this, to say that Q has transitioned from just making rap music to making art. Because rap music is <strong>art</strong>. Full stop. I think it's most accurate to say that Q has evolved his pen from an everyday handwriting tool to a calligrapher's prized possession. He has never forgotten his beginnings, but has also never stopped pushing himself to be better, since his peers also have never slowed down. BLUE LIPS is Q waving a blue bandana and saying "I'm still here, I'm still gon be here, and I'm gonna keep getting better".

        <h3>9. The Loading EP by Mez</h3>
        <p>
          The artist credited as Mez, also known as King Mez, or XXX, is a multi-disciplinary rapper, director, and designer. Originally from Raleigh, NC he's signed to Dreamville and was on <a target="_blank" href="https://alfred.dev/top-albums-2019#rotd3-dreamville">ROTD3</a>. His creative process is self-described as "How far can I take this concept with this medium?". The concept of the EP is pretty self-explanatory given its name. <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0115TJHVUY/loading/838a3a130b5798ca.gif"> Mez is 34, and has been in music for over a decade publicly, and behind the scenes even longer. He's patient and has been biding his time and knows that he has not hit his ceiling yet. This album is about showing how far he's made it and also how far he has yet to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mid point on the album is Bat Phone and oh man do I always love a <a target="_blank" href="https://alfred.dev/top-albums-2020#while-the-world-was-burning-saint-jhn">Saint JHN</a> hook. He's one of those people who knows the specific reason he's been asked to be on a song and only does that. No surprises and no secrets but always perfect execution, 10/10 no notes. 📝
        </p>
        <p>
          Saint JHN offers Mez the perfect scene to reflect on his come up, and the folks who he has had around him while he was pursuing his future. Mez begins by telling us about his childhood growing up with a mother who was a victim of domestic violence and how she finally moved them away after realizing how it was affecting the kids, losing his grandmother, and watching 00s TV shows like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108684/">Aaahh!!! Real Monsters</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214341/">Dragonball Z</a>. As he reflects he also accepts changes must happen with a witty "But things change, I mean what jazz look like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Malone">post-Malone</a> \ What what rap look like now? Post Malone". Now I finally get to write about famous crooner-turned-country artist culture vulture Post Malone. Mez sees Austin as a symbol of how someone not from the culture can do so well by borrowing styles and then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/newonce.paper/videos/910665569107473/">disrespect it by dismissing it as one-dimensional (skip to 7:20)</a> and leave for greener pastures once they've used it up. We've seen it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KSOMA3QBU0">time</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Gun_Kelly_(musician)">time</a> again.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Hot Spot, Mez is excitedly telling us how he has found a woman that he's completely enamored with. Obsessed with her to the point that he's making up scenarios in his head and describing all the ways the world will change once they hook up. He's describing the fundamental forces of emotional connectivity that will be established when it finally happens. The song named after its theme bars from the hook: "This ain't that shaky Wi-Fi at your mama crib \ This like a hot spot cause we still gon' be connected when I go". The key words here are "when I go" because as he says in the opening lines "You know nigga tell plenty lies when they tryna penetrate" and on the hook "I'm fin to say \ Anything a nigga got to get you out of them jeans" this isn't forever. He's caught up in the lie himself which is an extremely dangerous place to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Mez is just tryna hit and confidently will say or do whatever it takes, Zay seems to take a more meek, but honest approach. Those of you who have read this before know that I am the world's biggest Isaiah Rashad fan and every verse he spits is gospel. Rashad brings his unique and signature hazy flow where on first listen he appears to be mumbling and fumbling over his words as the nerves catch up as he's describing what he thinks a woman of this caliber must be doing and how she must be moving with all her other suitors. As you continue to listen though, you realize it's just fast and he's not exactly talking straight at you but it's like he's looking at the floor because he can't make eye contact with her. Every word is clear though, he's telling her what he's heard about her, and how it has interested him, and how he is the exact kind of guy that matches what she's into.
        </p>
        <p>
          This album overall is transitional to me, Mez defiantly can voice his appreciation for his past and then hungrily declare "<a target="_blank" href="https://streamable.com/dejysc">Job's not finished.</a>"
        </p>

        <h3>8. Alligator Bites Never Heal by Doechii</h3>
        <p>
          Doechii is on a speedrun to superstardom. The Florida-born rapper and songwriter signed to TDE and has been waiting for her moment ever since. My first introduction to Doechii was on her <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INjZRsMP5-k&list=OLAK5uy_k_IsMecTEZy2u3ssbK1qq23gV3eX-10bc">2022 EP she / her / black bitch</a> where Swamp Bitches ft. Rico Nasty took over my life for a few weeks and while I liked it, I knew I needed to see more. Alligator Bites Never Heal is more. The major label debut by Jaylah Hickmon, Doechii, has YEARS of study served up in an easily consumable replayable project. This album has something for rap nerds, theater kids, Tiktok kids, and people who just want hot girls to rap more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This album is unflinching and confident just like Doechii is. She is explicitly aware of her position in society as a Black woman and also as a talent that has to work twice as hard to succeed where some of her fairer skinned peers might get a pass. Her nods to her culture and background are not subtle. Her signature long cornrow braids and face tape are always present whenever there's a camera around. She even got extra creative with hair and costuming on her <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggg45-e4oj0">Colbert performance</a> which I beg everyone reading this to watch. Matter fact, just watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91vymvIH0c&t=1s">her Tiny Desk</a> too, and watch her <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSewCqAK7p4">Genius Open Mic (ft. Issa Rae)</a> while we're here. That's your now pre-work to be able to understand this album and everything I'm gonna talk about here. She works very publicly and exclusively with Black women and you just love to see it. Lots of people don't like that and some folks online were calling her very fast rise to popularity manufactured and that her music wasn't fun enough to be this big, some going far as to call it "slave music" and here's <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/officialdoechii/status/1867056159108035062">Doechii's response</a>. That's media training baybeeee!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Like I said, the album has so many different styles and even Hickman knows that. On BOOM BAP she lays bars over a little soul sample a la 2006 Kanye where she says it herself "Say it's real, and it's rap \ And it boom, and it bap \ And it bounce, and it clap \ An it's house and it's trap \ It's everything \ I'm everything!". This is direct shots at anyone who will come at any artist who raps for not being "real rap" for not just doing 64 bars no hook over a boom bap beat. We're not in New York in 1988 anymore, rap is bigger than that. Doechii is bigger than that.
        </p>
        <p>
          She released a multi-part old-school Black sitcom short series as promo for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0cdbR5ognY">her music video for DENIAL IS A RIVER</a>. This is musical theater people, stand up and pay attention. This is how you market a music video and keep eating off an album for months later. She hit the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/xI4NL6Xly10?si=knfWadQZadZrnUi9">telenovela</a> market, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZFrEqEuQcM">physical <em>slapstick</em> comedy market</a>, and just <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=494fsccKj9Y">awkward</a> comedy market. The song itself is Doechii and her alter ego telling the story of her mental state while she underwent the last few years and how what's been going on in her personal and professional life has affected her. She's mad about it, if you couldn't tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doechii has been working very hard and is just starting to be rewarded for the last few years of effort. She's received co-signs from everywhere, a place as TDEs biggest up-and-comer, and most notably Grammy nominations. Notably 3 Grammy nominations for Best New Artist, Best Rap Performance, and Best Rap Album. She probably won't beat Not Like Us for Best Rap Performance, but if you ask me she has a good shot at the other categories, though it's very rare a rap artist wins Best New Artist. The Grammys hate rap.
        </p>
        <p>
          This album won't be the last time we see Doechii. She has the support of TDE and she's playing the game for keeps, eschewing the chance to make the musical equivalent to fast-fashion, viral TikTok hits, and letting the music speak for itself. She's playing the long game and I'm strapped in waiting patiently to see what else she releases.

        <h3>7. MUTT by Leon Thomas</h3>
        <p>
          The sophomore album from Brooklyn native Leon Thomas is a textbook R&B project. This one is for the real lovers of the genre who miss when it was all about yearning, metaphorically cheating and love songs. This is Real™ R&B. We haven't seen a male artist channel the roots of the space lately the way Thomas has in years. When I was doing research for this one I had "student of the game for sure" in my notes because of the clear understanding of music he has displayed. Thomas would also say the same for himself when he says: "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.essence.com/entertainment/leon-thomas-mutt-creativity-and-next-chapter/">I’m a consistent student of the game and every collaboration is just a new class</a>". Leon Thomas honors those who came before him while pushing the bounds of his own artistry forward with every note.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a child star turned songwriting Grammy winner, he has worn a lot of different hats in his public career. His introduction to most of us was in his role as Andre Harris in Victorious where he captured hearts and ears with his songwriting and piano playing. He was first nominated for a Grammy as a songwriter for his work on former Victorious co-star, Ariana Grande's, thank u next, though he didn't stop acting. Some may remember him as <a target="_blank" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J3EKueIEFPVDJ4s/giphy.gif">Issa's neighbor on Insecure</a> that she had a short-lived stint with. Right now, he's found his current creative home signed to Ty Dolla $ign's label imprint under Motown records. He's taken a lot of career inspiration from his label head here where he has been storing energy and biding time as a supporting act as he learns and grows until the star he has now become on his own. In the 2010s we had featuring Ty Dolla $ign as a genre damn near all on its own, maybe in this decade it'll be "feat. Leon Thomas"?
        </p>
        <p>
          The subject-matter that Thomas is most concerned with on this project can be largely categorized as "romance'. He's an oldhead at heart but a young man everywhere else. As he observes dating, experiences the single life, and evolves his own sexuality, he compares and contrasts his modern reality with the relationships he saw growing up. His grandparents were married at 20 and stayed married until his grandma died in her 80s. That's the kind of love he knew to be true and is searching for. He also has to grapple with the fact that that's just not the scene in modern dating and must grieve the love life he expected to have by now.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the title track MUTT, Thomas sings "She said to yo time, what's the rush? \ I said baby I'm a dog, I'm a mutt" where he owns his immaturity and lets it roam free and even lets it take over. He likens himself to a dog, completely unable to fight his baser urges and just wants to rush through everything and get to the point. His partner cautions him to slow down and enjoy their time together, both knowing that they aren't the only people who each other are seeing. Side note, eponymous tracks are so classy I love them. He balances the physical with the emotional on YES IT IS while begging "My ears are sensitive, so when I ask you is it mine, just say 'yes it is'". He's a little too dedicated to this woman who he doesn't know that well and has been just hooking up with. He's not quite a <em>hopeless</em> romantic but my guy, this stuff isn't optimistic.

          The combination of everything that is him on one song can be found on FAR-FETCHED. The scales are tipped in the favor of youth on this one. Thomas makes it known that with all this fame, the love life also feels like business. "250 FRONTED LIKE YOU WAS MY ARTIST \ 5G JUST TO CROSS THE ATLANTIC \ WE SAT IN SILENCE FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS \ YOU SCROLLED YOUR PHONE AND WE FUCKED WHEN WE LANDED". Truly this man is a trick tryna be a pimp. Like how are we talking about you dropping half a mil on a woman that doesn't even like you and somehow like you're bragging because you're <em>able</em> to do it? Where is the sense? Then he wants to pretend like it's <em>her</em> who is the clown in this situation starting the bridge with "She got dreams of love and marriage". I am embarrassed for him but it's something he has to learn first-hand I guess. This is all insane and I feel like writing this song means he knows it but Jesus Christ, still doing it anyways is real "for the plot" shenanigans. This is the true spirit of R&B: knowing it's a bad decision but being so down bad that you do it anyways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The finish line of the write-up happens to also be where we start, the opening track. This opener is a real thesis statement, and everyone who's ever taken a writing class knows you must restate your thesis after your argument. HOW FAST is a quick and speedy summary of the album. It has so many conflicting feelings racing at you all at once. It gets overwhelming every direction he tries to steer you towards. The hook overtaking everything with the braggadocio of "Feel like I just got off stage at the Grammy's \ Feel like I just bought a crib for my momma". His cadence and delivery coupled with the engine sounds make a song that clocks in at just under 3 minutes feel like it laps you even faster. Thomas blends his own musical ability, musical legacy, creative ancestry, romantic optimism and studious reflections to create a standard bearing album to drive R&B forwards to the future while simultaneously bringing with it everything that makes it what we know and love. 🏎

        <h3>6. GNX by Kendrick Lamar</h3>
        <p>
          Legendary artist Kendrick Lamar needs no biographical introduction from me. Just listen to the two classic albums he released giving you a glimpse into his upbringing, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Kid,_M.A.A.D_City">GKMC</a>, and his recent headspace, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Morale_%26_the_Big_Steppers">Mr Morale</a>. He did set a record for time between release of album and inclusion onto this list. I was probably halfway through the album when I realized... "man this is really good, it's gotta go on the list". He's no longer signed to TDE, opting to operate under his own imprint of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGLang">pgLang</a>, making this the <a target="_blank" href="https://alfred.dev/top-albums-2021#the-melodic-blue-baby-keem">second pgLang release</a> to make it onto this list. Though as a founding member of Black Hippy it also makes him tied for the title of second TDE-signee to be present on this list.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Kendrick has always held it down for Compton, I'd say that not since his major label debut, Good Kid M.A.A.D. City, has one of his entire projects felt fully "west coast". Every song is inspired by west coast greats and reflects Lamar's love for where he's from. This year he hosted the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pop_Out:_Ken_%26_Friends">The Pop Out: Ken & Friends</a> featuring every prominent Black LA artist and a bunch of ones no one outside of the city has ever heard of. All sharing the same stage and all invited by him. While we're talking west coast, and before I get deeper into the music, I want to share my thoughts on the catalyst for this return to regional rap sounds (at least, amongst the boy rappers).
        </p>
        <p>
          In October of 2023, Canadian popstar, Drake, released his most recent album, For All The Dogs, which included the single <em>First Person Shooter</em> (featuring J. Cole). This song was huge and it's line "Big as the Superbowl" where Drake and Cole liken their own fame and status to that of the NFL Championship Superbowl event. The song was the inspiration for the two artists to co-headline their "It's All a Blur Tour - Big As The What" tour.  It's not the first time Drake has done the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_vs._Lil_Wayne">two megastars touring together thing</a>. This would all be well and good except, in J. Cole's verse he says "Love when they argue the hardest MC \ Is it K Dot? Is it Aubrey or me? \ We the Big Three like we starting a league". If you ask me there is only one <a target="_blank" href="https://otaku.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Three">Big 3</a> and it's not any of them. Putting Kendrick's name in a song that he was not on was truly an unforced error. There were rumors Kendrick was <em>supposed to</em> be on the song though. Also something that will come up later is Drake loves to call himself the new Michael Jackson trying to show that their relative success is similar. For the sake of you the reader, I will say that <strong>there is no living musical artist who is as big as Michael Jackson in any genre and there never will be.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In March of 2024, mega producer Metro Boomin and trapstar Future released one of their many collaboration albums "We Don't Trust You" most notably, this album has a feature listed from Kendrick Lamar, someone we as fans have not heard anything from in a long time, on the track <em>Like That</em>. I was excited when I saw this feature, but I listened through just because I knew I wanted to hear it in sequence and oh boy did it not disappoint. Kendrick seems to be incensed and fires back at both Cole and Drake taking it back to his <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/bhQzWbyw0VI?si=zy8brrROZFqYbSWy&t=178">Control</a> mindset where he does not want rap to be lovey-dovey, he wants rap roots back where every MC is a competitor. "Fuck the big three, it's just big me \ These niggas BUMS!" Kendrick angrily records over the air horns Metro has cheffed up. Kendrick also delivers "Prince outlived Mike Jack", the comparison here that Prince is seen as the more creative contemporary to Michael Jackson's pop appeal. Shots have been undeniably fired. Not since Tupac vs Biggie has hip-hop had a beef that has included stars of this magnitude. Drake is no stranger to rap beef, beefing with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM4KExmp4Rg">Common</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTviZZCXt7I">Kid Cudi</a>, Pharrell, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724104806/https://twitter.com/meekmill/status/623700698509758464">Meek Mill</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/pushat/the-story-of-adidon">Pusha T</a> over the years and coming out largely unscathed even after taking severe battle wounds. The public was starting to think he could not be dethroned. If anyone could do it though, it'd have to be Kendrick. One of the few MCs with the pen to verbally eviscerate Drake and the star power and musical acumen to release a hit song while doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In April of 2024, Drake fires back with <em>push ups</em> where he calls Kendrick short (he is but this is lame as fuck). Drake also alleges that Kendrick's record contract is predatory alluding to the rumor that his pop verses for Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift were label obligations. He also claims that SZA (another TDE signee) is bigger than Lamar on Lamar's label. Drake takes the time to send shots back to The Weeknd, and Metro Boomin, where the former also sent shots Drake's way. For those who don't know Drake actually discovered The Weeknd, and Abel opted not to sign to Drake's OVO and do his own thing. This was better for Abel's career in the long run (hopefully obviously), but their relationship was never really the same. About a week later Drake dropped <em>Taylor Made Freestyle</em> which featured an AI generated Tupac verse, likely written by Drake and an AI generated Snoop Dogg verse also likely written by Drake. In this song the two west coast legends beg Kendrick to drop a response to push ups in a timely manner, hitting Drake back on every count possible. This song ends with a verse from Drake doubling down on the contract allegations that Kendrick didn't drop a response yet as to not split the audience's attention way from Swift's dead poets society which also dropped that weekend. Drake has done this before, he loves a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ykBvPOIc0">Back 2 Back</a>, 1-2 punch in beefs, where he smothers the opponent with two songs removing the momentum from whoever he has his sights trained on. It has worked fairly consistently when the songs were good but an AI generated song? With a dead west coast legend? Nah that's just GROSS 🤮. Using it to emulate a LIVING west coast legend is pure insanity. Snoop is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p229ldn4vo">America's cultural ambassador now</a>, but if Snoop wasn't so clear-headed this could've mobilized a lot more folks and made it a lot murkier, sometimes people forget he's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg#1993%E2%80%931996:_Murder_trial_and_acquittal">killed people</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          About a week later, in the final days of April 2024 the beef heats up another level. Kendrick Lamar has released <em>euphoria</em>. It includes the three beat switches he claimed he would come with on Like That. Lamar by name calls out Aubrey and Cole, threatens further activity and lets them know that he's here and ready to go if they want to take it there. Kendrick quotables include "It's not just me, I'm what the culture feeling" and "What is it the BRAIDS?" discussing how the musical audience feels about Drake nowadays and what possible motivation Drake could have for attempting to go at Kendrick in the music respectively. This was a direct shot that responded to everything Drake offered and brought more. He pounced on every insecurity; Drake's long and public history of beefing with just about everyone, Drake being a deadbeat dad, and much more. I'd just be transcribing the song if I said every line that Kendrick added that was a shot. Later that week, on the morning of May 3rd Kendrick dropped <em>6:16</em> in LA. The sunny ethereal track is delivered as an internal monologue around how Kendrick thinks about what he's called to do in this beef, while also getting in Drake's head around how sycophants and employees around him are in place of where loyal day-ones should be. The song also highlights Drake putting a bounty out for information on Kendrick to put in his follow-up diss tracks. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/reel/C6gdClArPXc/">official release only exists on Lamar's instagram</a>, functioning as a Drake-style back-to-back diss release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drake, ready to shoot again, on the evening of May 3rd, releases <em>FAMILY MATTERS</em>. This track fires back at everyone and everything. This song is Drake's best showing the entire saga and shows he's not dead yet. He doesn't only fire at Kendrick, but Rick Ross, ASAP Rocky, J. Cole, The Weeknd, and Metro Boomin. Drake feels like all these people have a problem with him and are just bringing it up now, they coordinated to jump him knowing none of them could stand on their own. In Drake's head he is the protagonist and the evil cabal is popping out in effort to end his hero's journey. Drake makes up that Dave Free (Kendricks, manager and long-time best friend) is actually the father of Kendrick's children. He also says that Kendrick is a domestic abuser and also has serially committed infidelity. To Aubrey's credit, this would've absolutely incinerated a lesser artist. He made two fatal mistakes: giving good bars to non-Lamar players and also bringing Kendrick's family into his sights. Actually, the third was saying "Kendrick just opened his mouth \ Someone go hand him a Grammy right now" on a diss track like its some kind of neg to be <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_milestones#Most_Grammys_won_by_a_rapper">generally critically acclaimed</a>??
        </p>
        <p>
          Within <strong>20 minutes</strong>, Kendrick Lamar releases <em>meet the grahams</em>. This track is delivered over the most cerebral, horror, serial killer beat. This song is a horror show in itself. It smothers <em>FAMILY MATTERS</em> in its crib, stopping it from living up to the production value of a completely produced and shot music video. Kendrick names every member of Drake's immediate family and lambasts them for their actions in raising and empowering Drake to be the monster he is. For Kendrick the gloves are off. He only softens up when talking to Adonis (Drake's son) and a mystery daughter Kendrick says Drake has where he tells them that it's not their fault who their dad is but that if they are interested in living a better path that Kendrick will show it to them. The Drake daughter allegations are never really supplemented with evidence, but the internet believed they found the now teen girl. I'm not gonna link to that here cause it's a minor and not substantiated. The crime scene that was meet the grahams leaves the listener with a really uneasy feeling, like this is where it can only escalate to violence from here. There is nothing Drake can say here that will soften this blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kendrick realizes that the vibe has changed and he has won. It's now time for a victory lap and to give the people a banger and he drops <em>Not Like Us</em> the next afternoon. This song was produced by DJ Mustard and gave us our lovely new producer tag "Mustard on the beat hoe!" which is just Kendrick repeating Mustard's existing tag. It's a west coast hit to its core. Kendrick in the first verse hits drake with a "Say Drake, I hear you like 'em young?" and sprinkles lines in around all of his OVO crew. Here's where we get "Certified Lover Boy? Certified Pedophile." and "Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A MINOOORRRRRRRRRR 🎶". Kendrick also shares a second verse that starts with a history lesson around Atlanta's upcoming during the Reconstruction Era where Black enterprise could thrive in the south. Not Like Us goes on to taking #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for weeks following its release, and the song is an instant hit. It's everywhere immediately. Drake, like a mouse making its last cry while under the trap, releases <em>The Heart pt 6</em>  where he tries to play off the musical beating he has just taken, and says that the beef is over and he won't be responding anymore. It doesn't matter no one was gonna listen to it anyway Aubrey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay so I've been a <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/alfredabab_io/status/1081595209119682560">Drake hater for years and he has been a known weirdo</a> so let's not pretend there's no bias here, but finally Drake has been toppled. <strong>What this all means and meant that the time and where we go from here</strong>: Kendrick successfully has resurrected an era of regional hip-hop. This is where we were in the mid 00s with Kanye's college series.  When Atlanta trap got big and Chicago drill got big, the two genres kind of merged together into the hip-hop sound that birthed folks like Gunna, Lil Baby, and the Migos. It's also kinda why every up-and-coming artist sounded the same from like 2018 to 2022. This beef brought boy rap back to its regional roots. Girl rap was already trending this way with Meg Thee Stallion and Glorilla. More importantly, Not Like Us reminds and makes more mainstream an idea that Black people already know. Not all skinfolk is kinfolk. This is largely applied to Black conservatives like Candace Owens or Clarence Thomas but it can be pointed at Drake as well. He operated the last decade as a chameleon, changing his accent, aesthetic, and lingo based around what was hot at the time. He profited off a culture he was not a part of and because the mainstream fans were not part of that culture, they also let him. As the latest victim of regicide he becomes the example for the music industry to just be yourself and write what you actually know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorry, please know that while Kendrick did this, he did not do this for us. <a>He is not our savior</a>. Kendrick has never been shy about telling us about his relationship with God. He comes from a long line of rappers who claim <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKJJiF8QJRc">prophet</a> in their lines as they feel that <a>God speaks to them and talks through them</a> when explaining their writing. On <em>reincarnated</em>, Lamar takes it a step further and channels what he describes his past lives <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lee_Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a> and <a target="_blank" href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a> over a flipped Tupac sample. As himself, he talks about his own short-comings and then includes God in the conversation in an effort to bargain for his own soul. God instructs Kendrick on what his goals on Earth should be and reveals that Kendrick is actually as much an incarnation of Lucifer as the devil is one of God's own. He tells him that he's come far but there is more for him to do while here. Kendrick has succeeded and ascended to great heights all while and giving back to his community. That he feels that there is still more to do, to me, is a trait worth mirroring in our own lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Lamar can feel that he hasn't done enough, he is rightfully angry at those who do even less. On <em>wacced out murals</em> he only makes allusions to the beef, but summarizes it as succinctly as possible. After winning the bid to perform the Superbowl halftime show in New Orleans, Kendrick received quite a bit of faux outrage from the YMCMB camp of rap. Notably Nikki Minaj, sent an <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1833266734142235027?lang=en">ampetamine-fueled tweet</a> about Wayne being snubbed for the role. This lead to Kendrick rapping "Used to bump Tha Carter 3 \ I held my Rollie chain proud \ The irony I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down", as Wayne was Kendrick's idol. The line is a callback to J.Cole's <em>Let Nas Down</em>. Then following with lines against anyone who would attempt to knock him for just being the best. There are many more quotables in this song but I am not your transcriber, I only hope to have given you the context to listen intently enough to understand the bars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the course of the project we hear female vocals in Spanish that come from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/kendrick-lamar-gnx-mariachi-singer-deyra-barrera-story-1235838467/">Mariachi singer, Deyra Barrera</a>. Lamar discovered her by accident, as she sang at a Dodgers game that Kendrick was in attendance. He then invited her to the studio, where she wasn't really sure what she'd be doing since she's... not a rapper. It doesn't matter, the collaboration gave us beautiful vocals that help broaden the vision that is gnx. This album really would not have been the same without her.
        </p>
        <p>
          As one of the many other introspective tracks <em>heart pt 6</em> takes us on another sunny west coast ride through the neighborhood. Lamar walks us through TDE's core four humble beginnings as Black Hippy. This is from Kendrick's point of view in the song but what I know, and what has made TDE such a force is that TopDawg found ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Kendrick Lamar, and Jay Rock and they wanted to start a label. But Top knew that a label start needed synergy amongst its artists, so he had the 4 of them live in a house together and refine their skills. That was back when everyone thought Jay Rock would be the one who blew up as he was the first one signed to a major label. Kendrick looks kindly on their start and seems to beam while rapping through it all. He then explains how he feels about super stardom and where they are now. He's understanding the decisions that got them here and his own mistakes with "My memory knowing Black Hippy didn't work cause of me \ Creatively I moved on with new concepts in reach". Black Hippy is a group of four solo artists who could come together to make magic. Kendrick could've dimmed his own light to bring the others up but he followed his own ego. There's no hard feelings but its no secret that there was another avenue that could've been taken. While it's reflections based in reality, there is no regret in Lamar's tone. He tells us everything here with great pride, finally allowing himself to feel proud, and allowing us to share in that with him. Fun fact, this is the first song in the heart series that is actually on an album.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's even more in this album to talk about and I feel like I wrote a lot here. Like how on my initial listen of <em>luther</em> I hated it because I feel like Kendrick ft SZA songs are bad but SZA ft Kendrick songs are the auditory equivalent of precious gems. Or how when I first heard <em>hey now</em>, I instantly thought that dody6 needed to put more music out expeditiously. Or Kendrick giving us "I did it with integrity and niggas still try hate on me, just wait and see \ More blood be spilling, it's just paint to me" as a warning shot to everyone else in hip-hop. I just think this one is worth experiencing yourself given the context, and I also feel like I've given you that. One of the most awarded rappers to ever do it has created a project and done even more to solidify his legacy for years to come this year. MUSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD

        <h3>5. The Year I Turned 21 by Ayra Starr</h3>
        <p>
          Who are you? Who do you want to be? What do you want your impact to be? I'm sure many of us asked ourselves those questions when we were 21, but Nigerian singer songwriter Ayra Starr has asked herself those questions and has generously shared her answers with us on The Year I Turned 21. Before you say anything, yes, Yoruba Nigerian, please refer to the Jollof Accords of 1960.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Year I Turned 21 is mostly an Afrobeats album, but I don't feel that genre categorization really means much so let's say it has Afrobeats building blocks, refracted through a Pop lens and a little R&B sprinkled on top but the kind of R&B-Popstar influence of Rihanna and Beyonce inching out from the foundation. With that description, hopefully it's not a shock that I'd say that many of the arrangements have been brought right back to the basics. They feel a little fundamental Poppy, almost textbook. She follows the formula but is never boring or cookie-cutter. You can hear the sound I'm talking about on Woman Commando, Rhythm & Blues, or Bad Vibes. I can not stress enough, that these descriptions do not mean she is not talented, actually on the contrary she demonstrates such a clear talent and ear for music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay so, Birds Sing of Money is such a strong opener. The refrain is Starr planting her flag in your subconscious, rent-free. "My mama told me givin' up was giving up, so I made another way / I told my bitches hold me down, hold me down 'cause these niggas are a plague / I run my city, run my life, run my mind, but I never run away / I'm so careful with my energy, please never speak upon my name". Every time this played in the song, I stopped whatever I was going on in my head and just <em>listened</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The title of the album is not subtle. It's a coming of age album where she comes to terms with all the changes that happen in life when you turn 21, how you're no longer a kid anymore, not a teen either, but not really fully an adult either. Combine those with the fame and high visibility that being a musician brings, you have a perfect mix for really not knowing what the fuck is going on at any time ever. On the song named for her age, 21, she talks about her own experience with folks treating her as if she's too young to know any better while trying her best to be more than she is, and eventually realizing that what she is is all she can be; a successful artist who has worked hard to get to where she is. She reflects on her success at this point with the hook she belts: "What it feels to be more than 21? I've never known, I've never tried, I've never loved". This song is how we know recording this project was therapeutic for her, I'm so thankful that she managed to get her thoughts in order and share them, she seems better for having done it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Ayra Starr makes a case for herself as next up. This album fits directly into its market as an exemplary project compared to her many peers. The mix of Pop, R&B, and Afrobeats has happened a million times, so it's always worth highlighting when a new talent manages to make something that does something very specifically different

        <h3>4. TRUST CEREMONY by Jhariah</h3>
        <p>
          On TRUST CEREMONY, Brooklyn native Jhariah proves he's a rockstar. As an independent artist, he has no major label backing and every move he makes is straight getting it out the mud. The album is a punk pop album, explicitly and strategically punk first. The project is visceral, raw, and authentic to himself and his experiences. The production all over the album goes at a whirlwind pace. He challenges you to keep up and dance along even if it's a little erratic. Jhariah doesn't let you stop for too long, as if he's afraid that if you stop, he won't be able to start again. He makes music like it's the only thing he ever wants to do and it's so lovely to see someone new to the industry crave music in this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jhariah is going his own way. The album feels like therapy for him, therapy to write, to perform and to play. At times it becomes a little too intimate, where we as the audience start awkwardly thinking we probably should excuse ourselves. It's like when your friend starts fighting with their parent while you're over their house and you're looking for any excuse to get away. He rebels strongly at times in the way that he feels like he's ready to blow everything up.
        </p>
        <p>
          My introduction to this artist was actually via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text">Tiktok <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0115TJHVUY/rip/9e1c6879b2cbaaac.png"><img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0115TJHVUY/blob-angel/6806103af701d445.gif"></a> where Jhariah posted it. He was getting comments after it went semi-viral saying that it sounded like "an anime theme song" and damn if he didn't own it and convert that authentic traffic into listens and publicity. It actually does very much sound like that, and I'd believe it if someone decided to put it onto a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofJUG4HwFQ">2006 Naruto AMV</a>. It just has that much depth to it. It builds so well and drops you off as he sings and belts out the "I can't take another daaaaaaaaay" to start the hook. I sat playing this song over and over, taking delicate care not to get sick of it while I waited for the album to drop. I did a really good job since I still love this song by itself <em>and</em> in the context of the whole album. I want to hear this song live so so badly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, I try not to highlight lows in the album reviews but this is like a relative low, but still a high in terms of music. Of course, I'm talking about BIG SHOT. It's the second single off the album, but actually one of my least favorite songs off the whole project. I don't think it shows off all his talent as well as so many other songs do. It isn't boring or anything, I just think it's a bit too formulaic? Like he didn't flex at all here? I want the Jhariah that belts and takes huge swings and rips his heart out and slams it on the table just so you'll listen a minute longer. Thankfully, Jhariah does that a fuckton on his other songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we traverse the themes of identity, we venture through CONTROL BABY. I can only imagine that this song is about Jhariah's queerness and his parents not accepting him. He sings "Come back when you have some sense \ You can throw your life away just not at my expense \ You're not the son I raised" from the point of view of a parent who absolutely cannot reconcile that their idea of the child they thought they owned would go a different way and do something differently than the life they as a parent made up for them. The song gets even more intense with "I can tell, when you see me, that my eyes look just like mirrors, my hands soft like clay, but did you raise a tool or a man?". I read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24234145-the-will-to-change">bell hook's The Will To Change</a> a few years ago and the lyrics to this song could be quotes straight from it. The basic parts of the book are boys are socialized into men by having their emotions beaten or shamed out of them to only be left as humans with only a capacity for physical labor, violence, and anger. Jhariah uses his eyes to reflect this back to his parent and ask if they want him to be a complete human with thoughts, feelings and emotions, because that's what he's trying to be, or if they want him to just function as an instrument of their own legacy without his own will. All of us are called to live up to our own humanity, but Jhariah specifically calls out masculinity in his own life and calls on the listener to reconcile their own upbringing and the human-being they want to be.

        <h3>3. King of the Mischeivious South Vol. 2 by Denzel Curry</h3>
        <p>
          As an often overlooked artist, Denzel Curry, has been making music for well over a decade. He's struggled to achieve the level of mainstream success his peers of similar tenure. He's usually relegated to emo rap or punk rap, but Curry has surpassed and outlived his contemporaries time and time again. The first few times, you'd assume it was a fluke, but he has consistently achieved heights comparable artists have not, as he has made it onto <a target="_blank" href="https://alfred.dev/top-albums-2018#">this list</a> twice. With King of the Mischevious South Vol. 2, Denzel Curry has put his name in to become the South's standard bearer and Great Uniter in hip-hops return to regional rap and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5MDFOfny8I">he's got something to say</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          KOTMS2 is a rap album. It's southern rap of all the different styles and flavors. The South itself has its own regions of hip-hop. Atlanta trapstars have been the forefront of the region and of the sound for too long. Denzel Curry being from Florida nods to his own upbringings on this project and taps everyone from southern legends to new blood. He taps Maxo Kream from Houston, That Mexican OT from Texas, 2Chainz from College Park, Kenny Mason of Atlanta, Kingpin Skinny Pimp of Memphis and legends Juicy J and Project Pat of Three-six Mafia of Memphis. This tape is a real who's who of the south. All it's missing is an Outkast reunion feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of New York's style of going bar-for-bar, Curry composes a symphony of artists going banger-for-banger. On SET IT, the hook of "RUN IT RIGHT THERE \ NIGGA WANNA SET IT OFF, SET IT RIGHT THERE" opens the track and builds from a low rumble to what will eventually become a stadium-shaking mantra. People are gonna risk their lives to this song trying to stay up in the pits that will open when it plays. Maxo Kream on a feature always slides. I don't really fuck with him cause he's the epitome of ignorance but I have to admit anytime he's a feature on an artist I already like, the song fucking hits. He rides the beat so well you don't even realize he changes flows to a total of FIVE times in 16 bars. That's fuckin talent right there, straight representing Houston.
        </p>
        <p>
          On SKED, Curry opens rapping over an old school southern track with some electrical interference layered on top of some  drums that bring us back into a time where everything wasn't digital. Kenny Mason follows quickly, grabbing the baton from Curry and goes for a good stretch. Mason lashes out on the start of the second half of his verse with "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttLJNOOsPiY">Fuck a truce, we was tuckin' tools, headed to Sunday school</a>" an explosive statement to follow what was already a high energy wound up verse to finish it off with his own take on the start of the hook. Now we get to the goods, Memphis legend Project Pat anchors this song with his signature "Pattaaaah" ad-lib and a booming verse where he rides the beat so well,  demonstrating for the youth just why he's been around so long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like I said earlier, Curry is often relegated out of mainstream hip-hop to subgenres of emo rapper (largely because of the success of his earlier work). He's not that though. Goes so far as to say such on BLACK FLAG FREESTYLE where he raps "I'm a Carol City nigga, mane, y'all hoes must've forgot / I am not an emo rapper and I ain't no fuckin' herb nigga / I was whoopin' ass since the first, second and third, nigga". Don't try to lock him in to a style cause he can do so much. That's not even the most important part of the song though. Even though Curry is a Florida native and is the executive director of this project, he's had to really contend with this Texas boys trying to wash him on every song they drop in. That Mexican OT is one such Houston rapper that comes through and takes over the song. TMOT comes through and SLIDES with "F.L.A, what the fuck is the deal? \ Bitch, I'm straight out of Texas, we keepin' it trill \ Got Kill Bill in me, and we got King of the Hill / I'm a Activis sipper, I stay crackin' seals \ Cocaine, get a hit with a hundred-dollar bill \ Ima delete 'em with milimeters, nah, for real \ I cut open people, you jsut Dr. Phil \ I'm beefin' with alligators 'cause I killed they cousin \ Just to make his bitch ass into boots". He's representing for Texas so hard with this verse, might make me fuck around and go visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curry has demonstrated his ability to go far from his concept album style previously, to a war general for a region. His proven talent for drafting features and collaborators of all levels of acclaim, composing lyrically dense bangers, and arranging southern hit after hit is a testament to his ear. He's already had a long career, and shows no signs of fatigue on King of the Mischevious South Vol 2.

        <h3>2. HEAVY by SiR</h3>
        <p>
          The artist, SiR, (that's really his government name) is younger brother to rapper D Smoke, nephew to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gouche">Andrew Gouche</a>, and his mother used to be a backup singer for Michael Jackson and Anita Baker. So when I say this music shit is in his blood, you might wanna just check the DNA. While he comes from a family of entertainers, he was also adopted by the reigning dynasty of hip-hop TDE. Being a Top Dawg means that he is tied for the title of second TDE-signee to be present on this list.
        </p>
        <p>
          SiR is of the TDE class after Isaiah Rashad and SZA. His signing <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321042125/https://www.instagram.com/p/BCY2W-wxZal/">was teased alongside</a> Lance Skiiwalker by Top himself. If you ask me, he's stayed consistent dropping Her Too in 2017, his debut November in 2018, and the follow-up to that Chasing Summer in 2019. He took a little time off for reasons we'll get into, but he didn't stop progressing or evolving himself, his music or his voice. He's a smooth R&B ballad singer and has lent his voice as a feature and as background vocals to many of his labelmates over the years. He's always been good for it. He can deliver any line in that signature singing voice and I'd be like "damnnnn he said that??". You know how the best singers don't just sing but use their voice as an instrument? SiR has that quality about him for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          On first listen, this album sounds and feels like a coming-of-age album. A metamorphosis where he can say he's finally the beautiful butterfly he was meant to be. It's not that. He's 38. It has similar elements though in that he shows us a side of himself that we don't see often and he gets vulnerable and brutally honest about what's been going on with him. He did grow and change into something better though, which will make sense when I tell you that this album was delayed because of SiR's own continued battle with addiction and depression. He was in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/sir-interview-new-album-heavy-1234989601/">rehab</a> getting himself right for this drop and oh am I so glad he's still with us. If you listen to the <em>ahem</em> ✨ eponymous track ✨ (Yeah at this point, there's a pattern here we don't need to talk about it), HEAVY he out right tells us: "Oh-oh-oh, I've been killin' myself softly / Wakin' up, rememberin' / I'm losin' sleep over dreams that were comin' true / Oh-oh-oh, I've been killin' myself softly / Lost my mind completely / I really hope I can find my way back to you". Which to his credit just sounds like a breakup that was his fault, but it's more in line with withdrawals than lovesickness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay now that <em>that's</em> out of the way. Let's talk about this ridiculously insane five track run of IGNORANT, KARMA, HEAVY, SIX WHOLE DAYS, and ending with NO EVIL. These five songs were so good in sequence I almost made them all standout tracks, but that was just not fair to the other entries so I dug deep and drilled out 3 to stay in line with the others. The first half of this album takes you on a journey! Like damn I feel like he brought me to his highest highs, I hit rock bottom with him, then we went to a house of worship and felt the Spirit overtake us, and now we are in recovery cursing temptation. SiR hits every part of his musical element in these five songs and truly they were so strong that this album would've probably made it to this list off the strength of those songs alone, thankfully the rest of the album is also good so  I got to place it this high.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know if there's a Zay feature I'm gonna talk about it so let's go right into KARMA. SiR opens us up with "Jackie's youngest baby I been crazy since the sixth grade \ Full clip on my mental, too official for your mixtape \ I can paint a picture so wavy the boat bends \ But lately I been burning the candle at both ends". For a SINGER to deliver this as a song opener means so much to me. This shit is so so so hard. He has so much fervor in his delivery. That's songwriting. That's lyricism. That's... just the fucking intro too. He ends that to hit us with the hook of "I need to stop treatin' hoes like I need em \ I'm too busy making promises but I can't keep them" and damn you right SiR, you <em>do</em> need to stop doing that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's talk about SIX WHOLE DAYS. Take me to church ⛪️ SiR! He creates a choir of one by layering his own vocals as he brings in the hook every time. It gives me chills. Every time I listen to this it makes me want to sing along. That's obviously what it's made for but you know how when something is clearly trying to get you to feel a certain way but it's so good at it that you're like 'You know what? Sure'. This song could either be a breakup song, or a song about missing directing and needing the guiding light of God. "Blinded by my own foolish ways" can be literal as in if you stare at the sun for six whole days you will be blind and you will, I cannot stress this enough, literally be a fool for doing so. It's so simple but he makes it sound so good. It also has a more sinister interpretation against the backdrop of his addiction, it's the kind of quiet peace that someone finds before dying honestly. It's the most hopeful sounding but in context is the biggest cry for help I can think of on the entire album.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd be an asshole if I didn't talk about other tracks that weren't on his mythical five track run, so let's talk about the combination of back-to-back masterpieces that are ONLY HUMAN and SATISFACTION. Any time he does his own backup vocals and harmonizes with himself I'm all for it. I think ONLY HUMAN basically functions as an intro for SATISFACTION. The outro to OH has a refrain of "Risking it all for a floating fleeting feeling" interlaced with his other feelings of feeling incomplete, and imperfect. He can admit that he doesn't make the right decisions every time, and understands that he can do better and also understands full well the consequences of his actions. All of this conflict is washed away once he reaches SATISFACTION. "Love me today, leave me tomorrow" he croons about the fleeting joy that substances give him. He's as clear-eyed as any addict can be about the damage their doing to themselves, and the serotonin that he's taking an advance on by abusing them. It's a slow descent for someone who knows what they're doing is killing themselves but is in denial about the immediate damage that they are doing to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          SiR has finally cracked this list but I think this is just him reaching the next level. The bar keeps raising for him and with labelmates like Doechii, SZA, and ScHoolboy Q, there's just no room for slouches. He leverages his strengths by conducting a raw and visceral vocal diary of his own struggles with addiction, fame, and romance by doing what he's always done. He sings. He channels it all into the music the same way his family did before him and we're all lucky that he deemed us worthy to share his inner voice with.

      <article id="born-in-the-wild-tems" class="album">
        <h3>1. Born in the Wild by Tems</h3>
        <p>
          Temilade Openiyi of Lagos, Nigeria released her (technically!) debut album Born In The Wild. Under the stage name, Tems, she created an album that to me, feels like home. Before you come at me I'd like to point you back to the Jollof Accords of 1960. Tems spent some parts of her early life in the UK and got her Bachelors degree in South Africa. Now she is a Grammy nominated artist in her prime. I only say it's a technical debut because she actually already has a songwriting Grammy for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_for_U">Wait for U</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tems kicks off the album with an eponymous track, Born In The Wild, where she strips down the production and just belts over an acoustic guitar. It's a beautiful serenade that sets the scene for what this album will be and an excellent sample of her talents. Following the R&B reps that Tems gets in on her intro, she serves us Burning and Boy O Boy at the midway of the album. Burning is the song that has grabbed a Best R&B Song Grammy nomination and Boy O Boy really feels like she's having fun doing some singing. She sounds incredibly comfortable in this pocket, it's mixed like a live recording rather than a studio one. It's a gloriously warm experience and her comfort is contagious.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't want you the reader to get confused because Tems is not mono-dimensional. As much as she makes R&B, she also has been wildly successful in what would be categorized as Afrobeats. On Love Me Jeje she nabbed her Grammy nomination for Best African Music Performance and the drums on it are a textbook African cultural influence. On Get It Right, Tems and Asake create something that I can imagine hearing at a sweaty Amapiano dance party in ten years. Speaking of sweaty Amapiano dance parties, if Get It Right would be played at one, Me & U would be played during a Netflix teen drama during a scene of a dance party where the main character can only focus on their love interest and the rest of the party is blurred out because they are so enthralled. If you listen to these songs and don't move at all due to the music I'll send you $5. Just know if you request that $5 from me you'll be permanently marked in my mind as someone with no soul and no taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's keep talking about Tems musical range and hone right in on Turn Me Up. It's dance party but also think <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0115TJHVUY/thinking_beer/cc9508de147bf7c2.png">. As she sings "No peace for the generations / They have us livin' in hallucinations / Don't wanna put us in the right directions / Don't wanna give us all the right affections" the listener is being exposed to greater injustices in the world as those in power control the narrative. She moves on from that, because preaching to the choir and all that and keeps it specific to whoever is courting her in this. She makes it clear that she thinks highly of herself and if you want to stand next to her, you gotta be on the same wavelength and care about the greater world around you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only spot on this album that didn't immediately grasp me was Gangsta. It reminds me of a radio hit, the type of thing made specifically for radio waves and play. That's not a bad thing, because it likely it could still be a sleeper hit. The content of the song is her explaining her own work ethic and embodying who she wants to be in music. She's a hustler and needs other hustlers around her to keep pushing her to the heights she craves so badly. This song is the perfect example of how she feels about the risks she took leaving her office job (and marketing career) to start making music. The song is a little fast though, it is over right where you'd expect a second verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first song on the album I fell for was Free Fall. I'm a sucker for a J. Cole feature even if he is corny a lot of the time. I really love the locked heart metaphor that is present in her hook and also his verse, where he has to consider what he can possibly do to get her back: "Soon as you let mе in, you start huntin' for the locksmith / Now the key I oncе had to your heart does not fit / I got three choices, batter your door or lock-pick / Or walk away confused at your logic". She was all for him when they were starting out and it was all sunshine and rainbows, but once things started getting even a little bit real she pushed him away and he has to either decide to push through and stick it out (and possibly overstep), or just give up. Lots of yearning channeled by the two perspectives on this track and damn if we don't all love a little bit of guitar backing those feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't even gonna write this part but Voices In My Head is so African lmao. Like every phone call with an uncle where it sounds like they are talking about something wise but it's actually nonsensical. "You don't hear subjective truth, you hear objective lies". What the fuck does that mean??? But you still gotta think about it like <a target="_blank" href="https://media1.tenor.com/m/fGpOQn9Ep6UAAAAC/wee-bey-thinking.gif">Wee-Bey</a>. The real advice comes from someone telling Tems to be courageous as she chases her goals: "Do it crying as long as you're doing it" is advice some of y'all need to hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes when an album is really really good, I have to stop myself from trying to write a book report on every aspect of it that I like and the parts I don't like and the parts that really just stick out and are interesting to me. I don't do that because I want you, dear reader, to go and listen and take the context that I've shared here and listen to the album and draw your own conclusions and get your own joy from listening. This Tems album Born In The Wild is one such project that I truly feel deserves a listen by everyone who loves music. Tems manages to combine her passion for singing, her Yoruba roots and her modern outlook into a powerful debut that sets the standards incredibly high for the Grammy award winning musician. A debut album that is on track to win more awards for a career that I can only hope lasts a long time all come together as the reason that Tems presides magnanimously at the top of this list. 👑
