        Before I get into the write-up, there are only 6 ranked albums here instead of a full 10. 2020 made it hard to enjoy things for a long time and that includes allowing music to resonate with me and really excite me. There were many other albums that I did enjoy and did acknowledge as good, but they didn’t connect with me enough for me to want to write about them here. I chose these 6 because I could get excited about them and am excited to share my feelings on them with you all so please enjoy all I can offer to you at this time.

        <h3>WITH by Sylvan Esso ✨</h3>
        <p>
          Every song on here is technically a re-release, so I didn’t number this but I did want to say something about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve seen Sylvan Esso live 4 (maybe 5?) times and they are continually my favorite live show. My affinity for them goes past just enjoying their music and listening to talented people perform. The way Amelia and Nick craft a show that makes you comfortable from the moment it starts until the very end is a master stroke in their industry. They encourage you to bring your very best authentic self, dance like no one is watching, and enjoy the weirdness that follows with the explicit guarantee that you will be loved during and after no matter what. We are constantly told to hold parts of ourselves back in our day-to-day and a large gathering of self-expression and love is a wonderful release from that. It’s comforting. It feels like home. In a year where we didn’t get all the live shows we would have, it’s an act of kindness to release a live album so your fans can relive such an experience at home.

        <h3>6. VERY ALONE by Zaia</h3>
        <p>
          There is a feeling in this album that I can only describe as asphyxiating optimism. It suffocates you. The production fills your lungs, and the pressure reminds you to exhale. The title track “VERY ALONE” makes you brace for an impact that’s heading straight for you. It surprises you when it hits you. It’s soft. It props you up against something else you didn’t realize was there, catching you before you fall. The albums helps you stand steadfast. You are able to release all that tension you had pent up inside and your body gets lighter and lighter. The album closes with WINGS and WONDER and they keep the sensation going until you find yourself being carried along with the by the longer notes he hits as he stresses the ending syllable of the word “wonder”.
        </p>

        <h3>5. SuperGood by Duckwrth</h3>
        <p>
          Duckwrth borrows Go-go sounds, blends them with R&B and then picks up the tempo for a dance party masquerading as an album. The whole thing just makes you want to dance!
        </p>
        <p>
          The album runs the full spectrum of dance styles but they all <em>ache</em> for having someone to dance with. “Money Dance”? Bounce! “Trickin’“? Grind. “Too Bad”? Shyly two-step in the corner waiting for the bridge then scream jumping in the air at the top of your lungs until you’re grasping for air, lose your sense of self and become one with the crowd in a moment of sweet, sweet concert bliss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two double pack of Kiss U Right Now / Did U Notice is my choice for love song combo of the year. Did U Notice is about that time where you have a crush and you just want to be noticed by them! As if this person acknowledging that you’re alive will make or break the rest of your life, the yearning is palpable. Now, if Did U Notice is about the early stage, Kiss U Right Now is when your love is in full swing. It’s so romantic because it’s describing the stage in a relationship where you, seemingly out of nowhere, see your partner do something innocuous and you’re overwhelmed with how much you care about them to the point you literally don’t care anyone else is watching you have to express yourself and kiss them! It’s real. It’s primal. It’s just so raw and your body craves it. The passion is what binds these, and I fucking love it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the joy in this album is ever-present but it does not make light of the negatives, it’s just letting joy penetrate in spite of those negatives! Duckwrth owns his joy and thus gives us license to own ours and even goes so far as to challenge us to find ours on the closing track Find A Way.

        <h3>4. Dreamland by Glass Animals</h3>
        <p>
          It’s hard for me to write a review for this album. I like every song and I don’t have a coherent thought as to why the <em>music</em> is good, it just is. Every note of it. That’s it, so I’ll talk about the band instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their drummer, Joe was in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/glassanimals/posts/10155282127891152" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">really bad accident </a>in 2018. Like really bad. He sustained damage to the part of his brain that controls speech and. He literally had to re-learn how to speak and walk again. This delayed the recording of Dreamland and brought about questions on whether the band would even continue to exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The band decided that if there was even a <em>chance </em>that<em> </em>they could keep their original drummer they’d have to take it. They ended up cutting a tour short and losing a lot of peak time to capitalize off of their sophomore album How To Be A Human Being (also a great album).
        </p>
        <p>
          Their patience paid off and Joe recovered! But they still didn’t know if he’d be able to play drums again. Joe wanted to play and so the band doubled down and said they’d wait for Joe to re-learn how to play. Joe <a href="https://www.spin.com/2020/05/glass-animals-open-up-about-drummer-joe-seawards-life-threatening-bike-accident/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worked his ass off to re-learn how to play drums</a> and then when he said he was good to go, they started recording Dreamland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glass Animals had lost some hype by the time Dreamland was being recorded and released, so they weren’t confident that they could sell out stadiums, and even if they were more confident, they didn’t want to put too much pressure on Joe to come back and force him to play stadiums (possibly disappointing like an order of magnitude more fans).
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of a stadium tour they planned and performed the <a href="https://twitter.com/glassanimals/status/1225796474090459136" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Déjà Vu tour</a>! They booked all the venues they played in their first ever tour (which were smaller and more intimate) so Joe could have the comfort of smaller shows and they could offer their most diehard fans a chance to relive an intimate Glass Animals show before they moved on to a stadium tour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last show I saw before COVID-19 shut everything down was Glass Animals at the Sinclair and it made me so happy to see Joe on those drums. He was working his ass off and you could see it on him. Dude was the sweatiest person on stage. He was trying his hardest to focus on playing his instrument to the best of his ability ready to leave it all on the stage. We weren’t even the first show! He must have been working this hard on every tour stop. I’m so thankful to the entire band for sticking together and giving Joe the chance to play again and also for being the last live show I’d see for what seems like a few years. I couldn’t have asked for anything better.
        </p>

      <article id="ungodly-hour-chloe-halle" class="album">
        <h3>3. Ungodly Hour by Chloe x Halle</h3>
        <p>
          I think the best sign of a great signer is that they can use their voice like an instrument. Chloe x Halle are more than one great singer, they are TWO great singers. The harmonies these two pull off with each other are so impressive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The album opens with “Forgive Me” and the song makes you feel sexy as hell. Like red-bottom stiletto to their neck sexy. Honestly, every song does. From “Forgive Me” to “Catch Up” you’re the hottest person in the room and no one can tell you otherwise. That’s art. By the time you get to “Do It” you just completely believe them when they sing “That’s just how we do it and you can do it too!” like, damn maybe they’re right. <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T4NDG8VNZ/feelin-myself/5bc6bc9b58384c7e.png" alt="feelin myself emoji">
        </p>
        <p>
          They ground themselves as the album hits its latter third with the stretch of songs from “Overwhelmed” to “Wonder What She Thinks of Me” where you get a more vulnerable, introspective side of the sisters and really it was just to humanize them and throw you off the trail of them being legit goddesses. The misdirection works for a moment but then they end the album with ROYL and you remember you’re experiencing something truly incredible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is their sophomore album and they’re 2/2 for Grammy nominated albums and I can’t wait to see the rest of their run. I’m sure I’m gonna enjoy every single project they release.

        <h3>2. While The World Was Burning by Saint JHN</h3>
        <p>
          I had seen Saint JHN’s name on the internet a few times but never really listened to him. I think everyone has heard <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0zLCBJZSiELJf02ucPP9wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>that</em></a> “Roses” remix but what I didn’t know was how different it was from the original, or how different it was from the Future remix. The Imanbek remix was my gateway to liking this album but once I got to the album, I found I liked Saint JHN’s real style a lot more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saint JHN and this album really let me channel my inner fuckboi… but also my inner sadboi? Listening to his music makes me want to wild out and do shameful shit with drugs and strippers and then at the end of the night propose to one and leave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKq07z_tFzY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this life of sin</a> behind. Not since Trilogy-era Weeknd has a body of work made me hold this level of musical cognitive dissonance. Fuck it <s>mask off</s> <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/500/667/619.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two wolves</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Onto the music, his style is reminiscent of pop-trap mixed with NY melodic rap. I think the most accessible analogy would be if NWTS Drake was from New York. I wish there was a better word than reminiscent but it’s the most correct word I can think of to describe the familiarity in his production style. The refined edges of the production are what makes this album unique-- Saint JHN stands alone. There are two things I believe to be true without conflicting: 1) no one is making music like Saint JHN right now and 2) the parts of Saint JHN’s music that are so easily likable are extremely familiar sounding. One explanation for the familiarity might be the extensive list of high profile features he accumulated on this album, but it falls to scrutiny after acknowledging that even his tracks with no features have the same core sound to them. Because of this, I always end up listening to the album all the way through when my intention is to just listen to one song.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do have to acknowledge the negatives to this album of which there are two that are truly just embarrassing
          <ol>
            <li>
              Kanye’s Smack DVD verse would’ve been his best all year if not for his anti-choice rhetoric and he’s a fucking weirdo for including bars like this where he is so loud and wrong. <a href="https://genius.com/21460192" target="_blank">“It’s a thousand black babies gettin’ murdered every day \ They don’t know where to go, how to build a plan A”</a>. Abortion is healthcare and before you come at me and say Margaret Sanger was actually racist please save it. <a href="https://rewirenewsgroup.com/article/2015/08/20/false-narratives-margaret-sanger-used-shame-black-women/" target="_blank">She was racist but like, not on some conspiracy to sterilize Black women racist, just very normal early/mid 1900s racist.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              DaBaby’s verse on “Monica Lewinsky” because it was almost a good verse and he even started out by doing the melodic flow Saint JHN and A Boogie use but then flow-switched midway through and delivered some of the most throw away bars I’ve ever heard. “I hit it twice a day, she gave me two fucks \ Fucked her on the all white sheets Ku Klux” ??? Someone stop this man
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h3>1. Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 2 by Tkay Maidza</h3>
        <p>
          Album Of The Year!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Tkay Maidza can do any musical style and please do not try her because she might just fuck around and make a classic.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://instagram.com/tk80mb" target="_blank">Tom</a> said it best when he said it “has something for everyone”. <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T4NDG8VNZ/blob-clap/b2d468312352de4d.gif"> Since some of you might remember Baby Keem’s DIE FOR MY BITCH <a href="/top-albums-2019#die-for-my-bitch-baby-keem" target="_blank">last year</a>, that also means Tom is 2/2 for recs that make it on my album of the year lists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EP starts off with “My Flowers” which if you didn’t know what you were getting into, gets you’ started off with nothing too crazy but then the hook comes in and you realize you’re in an alternate world where ambrosia fills the air and Tkay is slowly taking over your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          “24k” has Maidza going for a more dancy vibe with some pop influence, and definitely an electronic dance inspiration. It’s so bubblegum fun in the beginning and then she just goes and raps over the same beat like “oh yeah I can do this too” and her words get delivered as a challenge to every single rapper to try and fight in her arena if they fuckin’ dare.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Shook” is so similar to early 2000s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDtn_FtU614" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hip-hop collabs</a> and that’s unsurprising because Tkay is 24 years old so she probably grew up on this sound as much as the rest of us did. The second verse of Shook <strong>commands</strong> your attention by opening with no backing track and bringing the beat back in after she handily verbally differentiates herself from the rest of us who are just here to sit quietly and watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next song is “Awake”. My original reaction was “holy shit this is heat why did she go so hard?” I stand by that reaction. I don’t usually get into JPEGMAFIA features/production its just not for me. This song though, he brought his flavor and it did not eclipse or overshadow Maidza’s. They fit together like puzzle pieces, feeding off each other and constantly raising the bar for one another. The best rap collabs are those where they can see each other as collaborators and competitors at the same time and I think they nailed it with this song.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh my God “Grasshopper” was brutal I don’t even know how to describe it. Her flow and this beat there’s nothing better <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T4NDG8VNZ/chefs_kiss/c4a50126f025f44b.png"> . She said “More bread, more heat \ that’s toast”. What other rapper is giving you a double entendre describing how to make the most common breakfast in the country while also declaring it was a done deal that she would keep making music successfully? No other rapper, that’s right. Your fav could never. I only regret this going over my head on first listen and not making it my Slack status.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maidza decides to take an early victory lap with “You Sad” and this level of confidence is so wild you can only sit and respect it. Not many people can show this level of confidence and be completely justified in it like holy fuck yea you’re right it is that good, carry on.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Don’t Call Again” is the perfect closing track as Maidza and Faux sing about being completely done with their situation and to not ask any follow-up questions. The album speaks for itself, if you have more questions you just didn’t get it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tkay Maidza can do so many styles and has so many talents displayed on this fairly short EP but still has her own ability to carve out a unique sound for herself. She effortlessly blends genres and moves seamlessly between different sounds. This is someone who sees the Big Picture™ and further than that understands how to weave her different canvases together in a way that has a thread of consistency but keeping each piece able to stand on its own.
