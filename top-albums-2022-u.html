        Maybe this will become a habit, maybe it won't, but I only did 9 again this year. Our honorable mention 10th slot goes to <a target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvsYXqtYjMYe0HISFaU0_B4Mg7653AAKH">CHAOS NOW* by Jean Dawson</a>. And as is tradition, here's your <a target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3hwQJzyIoFeakN26KLHTwd?si=2ff015331a9847b1">playlist</a> of the albums to listen to as you read this.

      <article id="dsm-van-buren-records" class="album">
        <h3>9. DSM by Van Buren Records</h3>
        <p>
          The album DSM by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/07/01/sound-on-van-buren-records">Brockton rap collective</a> Van Buren Records rounds out the list this year. We love to see MA groups coming up around these parts. This is a <em>group</em> a la Brockhampton though with an impressive 1️⃣3️⃣ members! My first intro to the Van Buren-sphere was <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3vIZxLgag86V9Iq0RMtfRy">SAINT LYOR'S IF MY SINS COULD TALK</a> which didn't hit me like I wanted it to, but it was 2020 so I don't really blame him. The thirteen members each have different areas of influence such as rapping, producing and fashion for the group. This isn't even a cohesive project like the other albums but holy fuck they are so good at rapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          They started as independent artists all dropping their own stuff and just made friends and connections and now they have two group projects. As this is their second project together, they felt like they had to prove the success they had with the first one was not a one-off. I didn't even listen to the debut but they proved it and they have my full attention now. It's also so <a target="_blank" href="https://djbooth.net/features/2022-09-14-van-buren-audiomack-interview-dsm-album">aggressive and undeniable</a> which was clearly intentional. They really are trying to outrap each other, constantly challenging each other to improve. The best example I can think of for this crabs in a bucket behavior is How To Kill A Narcissist. The track has the iconic <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pujKOJbWWKM">World A Reggae</a> intro and I wish I knew who was rapping on this and when but it really doesn't matter because each one of them goes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every song on this album makes me nod my head and make a stank face and I don't really even think the bars are that hard, but they are just SO outlandish and at the same time so subtly clever. On GET MONEY we hear "God sent, I didn't ask for it \ New beamer, got the cash for it \ Tinder bitch, had to match for it \ 100 more, then I fast forward" and actually I take it back, this shit is that hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm just gonna drop some snippets here that I felt were just <em>different</em> because I don't have anything else to say about this album

        <h3>8. wood tip by Zack Fox</h3>
        <p>wood tip. What does it mean?</p>
        <p>
          I've waited so long for Zack Fox to make music like this. This is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pypV-JPU1k" target="_blank">Jesus Is the One (I Got Depression)</a> rapper. He's been friends with Thundercat forever and a few years ago I thought his music would go the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCeiu4ozFGw">stick!</a> direction, a little experimental but still modern. From <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/zackfox/status/1618109651526246402">shitposting on Twitter</a> to being on the writing team for <a href="https://twitter.com/zackfox/status/1487132458642407424" target="_blank">NBC's Bust Down</a> you would think he was trying to just be a comedy rapper forever, but a comedy rapper with bars for real. If <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nOc5dPomCGF5iezfvSaOoBi_i8gHY0-2o">shut the fuck up talking to me</a> was him showing he can rap for real, wood tip is him showing he really understands music for real. Like this is the transition Gambino made from because the internet to Awaken My Love. The <em>music</em> itself changes so drastically but it is still so so good.
        </p>
        <p>
          ALSO THE <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khIOh7EzIl4">ALBUM HAS A VISUALIZER</a> WHERE HES JUST DANCING IN A PARKING LOT DRINKING AND SMOKING, but just a <em>lil</em> bit. It's saying I don't care who judges me I'm having a great time and why would you even judge me? We just living life enjoying it all. It's hedonism without the sin. This album is hopefully the ushering in a new cycle of music that returns us to the fondest, but earliest, vaguest of our memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an old-school 80s R&B, not even 90s/00s R&B but real old school you're gonna two-step in your living room with your partner of 17 years who you are currently having the same argument with you always have but instead you pull out some brown liquor just starting off a whole room apart trying to ignore each other and cool off and slowly get closer and by the time the last song is over the bottle is finished and its as if neither of you ever had clothes on or anything else to do. You can listen to the yearning in these tracks. You can understand to the desire. You can feel the pure primal NEED. "triflin' if you say so, but you won't stop thinking about my love". You know you're mad, I know you're mad, you know I'm mad, but we can't stay mad forever, let's get back on track.
        </p>
        <p>
          The music scratches a deep part of my temporal lobe that I didn't even know could be triggered, and I'm glad I wasn't the only one. Zack Fox reaches into the psyche of Black millennials and tells us "Yo you're old now, you're the uncles and aunties you used to watch and that's okay, they were having a good time, you can too".
        </p>
        <p>
          I love Zack Fox so much he's always really been <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/felonious_munk/status/1598377477067444228">that guy</a> and just like Quinta Brunson made herself out to an <a href="https://youtu.be/zRgs1mexjrU?t=132" target="_blank">award-winning showrunner</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/49567214">from memes</a>, Zack's on his way to superstardom straight from the same meme upbringing that Quinta had.

      <article id="working-on-my-karma-dvsn" class="album">
        <h3>7. Working on My Karma by dvsn</h3>
        <p>
          In the singer-producer duo dvsn's newest album, Working on My Karma, we get a classic R&B album. This is the kind of shit Usher would be making if he kept hanging out with R. Kelly. Maybe that's out of pocket but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ml8mGCr2Is">tell me I'm lying</a>. I had no idea that dvsn was a group, I thought it was just the singer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/danieldvsn">Daniel Daley</a>, but they are a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nineteen85_">producer</a>+singer combo. I take no responsibility for my ignorance because the Spotify artist photo is just Daley. The album is the model R&B album. It channels the 90s and early 2000s in a way where it might as well be one of the albums actually from that era.
        </p>
        <p>
          The album opens with Last Time and I just know this dude is <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/H64QG4UsrGI?t=13">singing this while against a wall with one leg up on the wall with his shirt open in the rain</a>. It's plays its role so perfectly and he's trying to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@twilaamoure/video/7184193616599108910">steal your girl</a>. The BLEU feature kinda feels out of place, but in context <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tcDXJfAFVw">let's</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8dyp89uWxA">be</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KL9mRus19o">honest</a> about the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0v4Hd431Gg">amazing R&B/Hip-hop collabs</a> that got crazy amounts of radio play. I'm not saying that's what this is, but you can kinda see what they were going for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, most of this album is about wanting to fuck. It is undetermined whom is participating in the fucking, but it is at least our protagonist (played by Daley) and an unnamed, and innumerable group of participants. We get it straight from the whores's mouth <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0115TJHVUY/winking-clown/849c6cc844f3865a.png" alt=":winking-clown" style="background: radial-gradient(circle at center, white 60%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) 60%);"> in Bring It where we hear lines like "Let me remind you \ Pussy is mine too \ But it's not about owning it, I just need to borrow it". The participants are basically accessories to them. I can only conclude that these niggas is criminals and this album is a confession.
        </p>
        <p>
          My personal Song of the Year is on this album and that song is If I Get Caught. ⛔️ Disclaimer: I do not currently, nor have I ever lived this life but the lyrics over this instrumental are addicting as hell and honestly the brazen toxicity is just too confident. Like come on, the audacity, where does it come from? We also get unrepentant lines such as "Don't forget I was a fly nigga when you got here". The entire hook is basically saying, yeah I did it and I don't regret it but also I didn't do it, don't hold it against me. "If I get caught cheating that don't mean I don't love you \ Don't let one little fuck, Mess all this up" Godamn dude please have shame, just a little bit of shame, I promise it'll be okay. The kind of maniacal tendencies he must have to somehow turn it on the person he cheats on and makes it their fault for reacting badly? Not since the Most Loyal <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_(rapper)">Nayvadius DeMun Cash</a> have we seen such brazen toxicity and misogyny, truly a master class for emotionally stunted fuckboys everywhere. It almost means something that the literal next song is named Stay Faithful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay so our protagonist starts being so brazen in these first three songs but realizes what he has done wrong and how it has made <em>him</em> feel. The album is a journey to self-awareness and some beginning stages of developing empathy. If dvsn is working on their karma, then once What's Up at the album halfway mark is when they realize that they have done wrong and are trying to come back half-healed to make things right with the one that got away. This is so obvious when you get to Touch It and you realize he's in a strip club, being tempted to break the cardinal rule about not touching the performers! He's begging to know if he can because he seemingly <strong>needs</strong> to touch. This man needs help, or if he can't get that, get him a cold shower.

      <article id="learn-2-swim-redveil" class="album">
        <h3>6. learn 2 swim by redveil</h3>
        <p>
          This is the debut album from 18 yr old DMV rapper Marcus Morton, aka redveil. He's specifically from Prince George's (PG) County, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/princegeorgescountymaryland">one of the Blackest places in the US</a>. It has very clear Jazz influences where the brass and keys building the foundations of the first song. From the start, the entire album feels very improvisational, like Jazz <em>should</em> feel. It's like you're listening seated in a lounge or a club. Morton's rapping style is A LOT like Doris-era Earl Sweatshirt. His voice can be gritty, and the beats can feel uneven at times but the confidence he comes with every time brings all the elements together to a unique but still evolving feel. I think it feels that way because this album is also self-produced and the young artist is absolutely still growing. To be so young and make an <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/redveil/status/1526332407560945664">AOTY-level project</a> is no easy feat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The improvisational fluidity of jazz is a perfect musical translation of the water metaphor he uses throughout the whole project which can be summed up as: "<a target="_blank" href="https://djbooth.net/features/2022-04-22-redveil-interview-audiomack">swimming means surviving</a>". In Diving Board, he's keeping time like he's about to run out of air, but never really does. It feels like he's holding in his breath for when he eventually resurfaces after diving in. He's rapping for rappers really. "Said we was pressing through to shine, now we here \ And we don't have the time to revel in fear \ Need to hold my nose, my nose, my nose". <a target="_blank" href="https://acclaimmag.com/music/redveil/#0">redveil believes diving straight into the deep end is the best way to learn</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the water metaphor runs deep throughout the whole project, it's also a lot about growing up. This project doubles as a coming-of-age album. He shouts out where he's from on PG Baby over a "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnAiJ3_Kr6Q&t=32s">Love Me Or Leave Me</a>" sample. He also meticulously sandwiches raps on Shoulder between singer Mekdelawit soulfully belting "Sit and watch my youth wash away". The growth that Morton explores here is rightfully not complete as he's still so young, but his reflective mindset shines throughout the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sixth track, Better, is the midpoint of the album that acts as a palate cleanser, where we break away from the brass instruments that were all over the first half of the album. However, we do not break away from his reflection and the development of his outlook. "Take it, take it, take it from me \ It gets better, better, better when you give it time" we hear on the hook urging the listener and also reminding the speaker that as long as you keep swimming, you won't drown.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the album winds down we are met with an incredible ending run that starts with Home. He's so happy now. He's was lost, depressed, unfulfilled, <em>underwater</em> but has now reemerged due to his efforts to grow and has finally found himself back in a good place where he can approach living in a completely different way. He raps "I can't fuck with niggas tryna play the middle these days, I ain't feeling brittle these days \ I been thinking about the plan, they been thinking about the vigil these days" with such a sense of confidence it's hard to not see his newfound optimism. He's gearing up for his next step. The refrain on the closing track Working On It is all you need to hear to confirm that. We hear redveil repeat "I don't wanna run no more \ I don't wanna run no more \ I don't wanna run, I don't wanna run." to the point of exhaustion, like it's his singular driving thought— almost instinct or impulse. If this album is Morton transitioning to his final form, I am so excited to experience his future works and get to watch him continue to grow!

        <h3>5. Special by Lizzo</h3>
        <p>
          Lizzo comes out with her FOURTH studio album, Special and it is exactly that! This is a pop album because Lizzo is a popstar ✨ but she mixes in R&B and raps the way only she can. The album better eventually be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/j-cole-has-had-enough-809480/">double platinum</a> because she has no features. While the album has no features, it has a wide array of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-07-15/lizzo-special-takeaways-myke-wright">samples and homages</a>. My favorite and most obvious to me being the flip of Lauryn Hill's Doo Wop (That Thing) to make Break Up Twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This entire album makes me feel like I'm in an 80s training montage and I can take on anything, even an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv9yzwzOaiQ">underground kickboxing ring in Thailand</a>. The tracks Everybody's Gay or 2 Be Loved (Am I Ready) could literally be on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx2gvHjNhQ0">Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack</a> or chilling next to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m26Fy2oTm1c">Men With Hats</a> and I wouldn't even blink, it's just so fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this album, Lizzo wants you to love yourself. The name of the album is special after all, and the title track chorus rings through the noise "In case nobody told you today, you're special \ In case nobody made you believe, you're special". She keeps spirits familiar and friendly with I Love You Bitch and Birthday Girl, where you're just her best friend and celebrating each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest song on the album is easily About Damn Time. It's nominated for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/lizzo/251879">Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance</a> at the Grammy's this year and it really does belong in the heights of its category. The song is not trying to be more than it is. Lizzo is celebrating that she's finally feeling healed and is ready to re-enter the world and deal with everything that entails. It's time to turn up and Lizzo has been ready for it. The song has a double meaning as it's her first non-single release since before the <a target="_blank" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home">COVID-19 pandemic</a> so it's about damn time to get outside after being inside for a year+ and trying your best to exist freely. For my first listen of this album, I was walking to a Western-style popup ranch where I raced Go-Karts and did some bull riding and some mini-golfing, so it was the perfect theme song to hype me up to socialize with a bunch of new people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like all great albums this one was not without some controversy that was quickly rectified and became a non-issue. In the original version of the track Grrrls, Lizzo had a derogatory word as part of the hook and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hannah_diviney/status/1535818662749548545">a Twitter user</a> made a point to bring it up. Lizzo's team fixed this shit immediately, released a new version of the song, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/lizzo/status/1536480260732047361">made a statement</a>. They handled it truly in the perfect way where they didn't decide to double down and didn't open themselves up to bad press. They just accepted the mistake, fixed it, and moved on and did all that fast!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, that we have that out of the way, my honest and stubborn belief is that Naked is Lizzo taking an opportunity to flex her actual singing ability on us. This song breaks from the upbeat pop songs into an intimate serenade. "Let down my guard, undo my robe \ I'm standing here, don't need no clothes \ I'm naked \ Love how you look at me naked \ Come make this body feel sacred \ I'm a big girl, can you take it?". It's so incredibly vulnerable to bare physical insecurities and describe them in this detail and then clearly revel in being wanted so bad while also allowing yourself to just enjoy being enjoyed. Then to top it off by being able to sing about it like this?? This woman is powerful. The way the music swells at the end "Come make this body feel sacred" that shit is primal in the best way, it's a feral command, it's an urgent need but also so authoritative 🥵 like how do you say no, how could you <em>want</em> to say no?
        </p>
        <p>
          This album ranks so high specifically because of how kind she is to the listener. She wants to make you feel good through music, she's not explicitly sharing pain, she's just here to help you have a long-lasting, good time. A healthy one that doesn't rely on stopgaps and half-measures, she wants you to know that you are loved and that love is deserved just because of who you are. This album is auditory dopamine.

        <h3>4. Gemini Rights by Steve Lacy</h3>

          Gemini Rights is an album with elements of Rock, Funk, and R&B, but its most prevalent genre is heartbreak. Lacy opens the album loudly and outwardly confidently with "Baby you got something in your nose \ Sniffin' that K did you fill the hole \ Hope you find peace with yourself \ New boyfriend ain't gonna fill the void". There's something extra petty about devoting the first four lines of your album intro to talking shit to your ex. I respect it. I respect it so much in fact, that when I finally do see Steve Lacy live and he starts playing this song I'm belting it out as loud and as hard as I possibly can. Lacy would say "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.anothermag.com/design-living/14353/steve-lacy-interview-gemini-rights-album">It's a fucking break-up album</a>" and if that isn't made clear from just the start, I don't know what to tell you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lacy started out in his highschool jazz band, and via a senior in band was connected with Grammy-nominated band The Internet and eventually became their lead guitarist. From there he was now affiliated with Odd Future, and went on to work with many major artists all before he could legally drink in the US. The Compton, California native was raised primarily by his mother and has two sisters. He's incredibly close to his family, and they're all very supportive of his musical ventures. They're in fact, so supportive that they have vocals on the tracks Helmet, Amber, and Give You The World. He is a really collaborative guy for someone who would call themselves an introvert and says that "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.anothermag.com/design-living/14353/steve-lacy-interview-gemini-rights-album">After shows I ball up in my room and don’t say a word for a couple of hours</a>". The two sides of Lacy are probably why he can appear to embody the Gemini star sign so well, or maybe he's just normal and all of this is overwhelming, either way I hope he manages to stick around the folks who love him and keep making music like this for a long time.

          While also being a family man, he's also the Problematic Pick™ of the year for some harmless reasons and some harmful ones. It's hard (and feels self-righteous) to hold a teenager to account for being immature with a big platform and making statements without really understanding the potentially deep impact they'd have. Steve Lacy is half Black and half Filipino which puts him in a pretty unique position in terms of identity. He's made bad-taste jokes that would raise eyebrows from both his maternal and paternal kinfolk and I can't add him here without at least linking them. He's said he <a target="_blank" href="https://www.queerty.com/hip-hop-artist-steve-lacy-comes-bisexual-hed-never-date-black-guy-20171004">would never date a Black man because he sees all Black men as competition</a>, which is weird as hell for someone who's been all over the world to say and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kirshteinkoos/status/1224788084664958979">he also stoked some anti-Asian coronavirus based tensions</a> in early 2020. Though, since Gemini Rights, fame, he's been squarely in acceptable rockstar delinquent acts like <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/turnthenotison/status/1584768010564571137">talking back to audience members</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/steve-lacy-destroys-fans-camera-bad-habit-1234617830/">smashing a camera that a fan tried to throw on stage</a>. I feel like I'm just extremely online by noting all of this, but the latter two are in no way equivalent to the former and I am not trying to say not to listen to his music after this, but the guy needs someone to manage his behavior in both the digital and analog world, and like with most artists I think that will come with time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bringing the focus back on the music, it's tough for me to want to write about any tracks on this more than the opening two. The album opens with the Jordan-Pippen duo of Static and Helmet. Some albums will have a 4, 5, or 6 track run that goes crazy but Gemini Rights accomplishes all of that in just two. Between Lacy harmonizing with himself over a guitar that we can only assume he's also playing and then the tambourine, mixed with guitar, and Lacy family background vocals you start to melt into the white noise of Helmet and you realize you better strap in for the rest. The <em>texture</em> of the audio on Helmet opens up a new dimension of listening that you're getting with this album, and that feels so exciting, especially when starting to take in a new project. Both songs feel timeless. You're not listening to some brand new sound but it's also not some legacy sound you've heard before. He has analyzed what's come before him that he's liked and managed to re-channel those sounds into what is authentically his own. If you listen to these first two and don't like either, you're just not going to like anything else I've written about here. I strongly recommend giving the entire project a deep listen because it is absolutely worth it.

        <h3>3. Hold The Girl by Rina Sawayama</h3>
        <p>
          Rina Sawayama is hopping out for her sophomore album with a follow-up even bigger than her insanely good <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawayama">eponymous debut</a>. The album Hold The Girl is filled with Pop power ballads and absolute epics 🎇. Each song just feels big. Each is its own grand production here to be enjoyed by you and 100,000 of your closest friends. I can't think of a song on here that doesn't feel like it is best listened to in a stadium. The tracks all basically call out for the biggest venues possible and after listening to them, it's impossible to want to deny them the opportunity. Sawayama's just getting started.
        </p>
        <p>
          This album was a lot more personal to Sawayama in that she has spent the last few years doing her own personal healing and creating this project was also an act to show how far she's come in that. She's basically saying "hop in loser we're working through our trauma" and honestly that's so generous to share that healing and forgiveness with those of us in the audience. One of the biggest antagonists in the album is the Church, or really anyone who uses Faith as an excuse to ostracize and condemn others. "Older and wise, God on your side \ I was innocent when you said I was evil \ But I took your stones and I built a cathedral \ Found my peace when I lost my religion", she sings on Holy (Til You Let Me Go) as a direct challenge to members of the clergy who disregard queer youth, right when they are in their most vulnerable. It's firing back at an authority that would rather tear down another person and push them away than accept them for who they are and help them find their place in community. She continues to take shots at organized religion on the track This Hell with completely fearless lines like "God hates us? Alright then".
        </p>
        <p>
          The next biggest thing she's healing from in this album is her upbringing. After immigrating to London from Japan, she <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thefader.com/2022/09/08/rina-sawayama-the-fader-interview-hold-the-girl">shared a bedroom with her mother until the age of 15</a>. She's working to heal her inner child and help herself get the things she didn't get while growing up. On the titular track, Hold The Girl, she sings to her younger self and describes how she wants to move forward being true to that younger version of herself. "Reach inside and hold you close \ I won't leave you on your own \ Teach me the words I used to know \ Yeah I forgot them long ago... Oh I wanna remember \ She is me and I am her". Not many of us knew what we needed as children, and even if we did, even fewer knew how to communicate those needs to our caretakers in a way that would get them addressed. Sawayama has the ability to communicate her needs now and has matured enough to understand how getting those needs addressed will affect her now.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's so much more to this album, and I'm not really sure I can do it justice to describe here. It's also a pop album though, so it's not like the meanings are hidden from the listener at all. It's absolutely worth listening to so that you can take in everything she has to offer us the listener, and she will definitely keep getting bigger and bigger and if there is any justice in the world she will end her career as a truly legendary pop star.

        <h3>2. MORE BLACK SUPERHEROES by WESTSIDE BOOGIE</h3>
        <p>
          What. A. Follow-up!!! MORE BLACK SUPERHEROES makes WESTSIDE BOOGIE the second two-time artist to appear on this list after his 2019 Shady Records debut, EVERYTHING FOR SALE. Boogie explores the different facets of his personality through crafting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k3--5vljPE">three alter-egos</a> that appear as characters on the album. Anthony is his everyday self, the father, the son, the guy who just wants to help everyone where he's from succeed and to not be underestimated while giving us the conscious, self-aware bars that we know and love. Rachet Boog is the flexing rapper persona with the bravado that makes all the hits. The last persona is Superblood Boog who is the superhero blood persona that makes the ignorant bangers and gets loud and aggressive. These aren't new aspects of Boogie's music but I really like that he gave each of them a life of their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best part of the alter-egos is that each one brings the energy, it's not all reserved for Superblood Boog. I know this because I saw him live this year and the energy was there every track. While other rappers are using backing tracks or only doing a verse and letting the hook play, Boogie really raps every word. Between Boogie, his team, and the fans, the room was <em>filled</em> with authentic gratitude, which might be a surprising contrast for a rapper who normally wears his bravado like body armor.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Anthony opens the album with KILLA MODE, I want to talk about Rachet Boog getting us off our feet with STUCK. It's a banger of a second track and I can barely even wrap my head around how energetic it is while still feeling like he's keeping his composure just so that he can accurately express himself. This song is him trying to be as vulnerable as possible but he's still racked with anxiety as the bridge plays "She gon' play me got this feeling in my gut \ Damn, I'm paranoid as fuck \ I been chilling in the hood why the coppers pull me up? \ Damn they always on my nuts \ Damn, the hood done got me stuck". He has a million thoughts and fears running through his head about every single interaction he has. All the traps of celebrity, all the traps of being a hood celebrity, and his hesitations around his obligations as a family man come out. It's always the deepest darkest thoughts that we don't want to show or even acknowledge we had in our own minds while in constrast Boogie bares it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he grapples with his own insecurities, we see how dealing with his own internal struggle gets projected onto his romantic relationships in NONCHALANT. I just like this song so much! It's two people in a romantic relationship somehow being their most insecure selves but also asking to be treated right by the other while putting their own concerns out there. They're letting their soft underbelly show here but usually the toxic stuff is how they respond. "You know I just wanna pick fights \ When you let the shit slide I get scared". They're testing each other's commitment immaturely, but they're both just afraid of getting hurt. They need to have an honest and candid conversation but this is the most they can do for now, and we as the listener just hope they can get there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest surprise of this album is that he GOT A SOULJA BOY FEATURE. I don't care what anyone says that is absolutely iconic. This song goes so hard, the beat is grimy as hell with that piano just HAUNTING the background. Is there a tambourine back there being shaken? This song is also the most toxic and had me stank faced the entire time. Soulja said "Rich off computer bitch Draco want top" and thats just so real. He started the "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp5A_1UAJog&t=2950s">Soulja boy did it first</a>" meme but this line is actually so true. He really made the YouTube rap era what it became and there's an argument that he's the grandfather of the SoundCloud rapper. His music going online and taking advantage of the Internet allowed so many others to recognize the reach you could get from being online. You don't really ever get prime features from him nowadays because he was never that good of a technical rapper lets be honest, but his presence here, and him being able to successfully anchor for someone with such a consistent pen just shows  he's not an industry legend for nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          My absolute favorite part of this album also happens to be the final one. In the second part of ANTHONY (WAR) we get hit with an insane beat switch that opens with "I think I'm too bougie now so I can't be caught at no Wingstop \ I think your top 3 got a year left, give 'em 3 tops". I ran that bar back more than three times when I first heard it because it was just so <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0115TJHVUY/chefs_kiss/cc8359647c55d9ad.png">. This is the perfectly condensed summary of braggy raps mixed with the vulnerability that is consistently channeled through the alter egos throughout the entire album.

        <h3>1. BLK VINTAGE: THE REPRISE by BLK ODYSSEY</h3>
        <p>
          Our number one spot, and Best Album of 2022 comes from the band BLK ODYSSEY, straight out of Houston, TX. The band is helmed by Juwan Elcock, his brother, Jordan Elcock, and their friend Alejandro Rios. BLK VINTAGE: THE REPRISE is an experimental album that blends Funk, Hip-Hop, Jazz, and Soul into a distinct smooth but ethereal sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those genres have a mountain of samples and influences to take from and BLK ODYSSEY do not shy away from leaning on those that came before them. In YA NO SALIR PODIA they borrow the melody of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4LVf9qdFYA">Coming From Where I'm From</a> by Anthony Hamilton to make a lounge banger where you are lulled to bliss in darkness by a woman talking under the instruments. I don't know what the hell she's saying because I can't make it out but the title translates to "I could not get out", coupled with the original sample's song title paints a story all on it's own. We go the opposite end of the spectrum with NINETEEN EIGHTY where we flip the iconic Gin and Juice "<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/fWCZse1iwE0?t=70">May I kick a lil something for the G's</a>" for the hook where we see a bouncy, inebriated hood narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The identifying feature of BLK ODYSSEY's Elcock is his authoritative, but hazy, soft-spoken voice. I was lucky enough to see the band perform live in Chicago and the set design was smoky and the room was mostly dark, just like the music feels. They toured with Eimaral Sol, with her as the opener and backing vocals during the headlining set! All of these combined hit absolutely deliciously. I was dead center front row as well as the venue in Chicago was a back of a bar stage with less than 40 people. There was enough space for everyone to be a little weird and soak it all in. My favorite part of the set was the performance of GHOST RIDE, where instead of playing the Mereba feature, we just did the hook a few times until everyone got it. Gotta shoutout Mereba here because right after announcing her own tour, she was promoting this song and I would've never found this band without that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay so, this album goes a lot of different directions but there is only one pure love song on the album. That track is HANG LOW. On the hook Elcock croons, "Sweet like lemonade \ Blood drips from here veins \ Hang Low \ Skin like marmalade \ Put voodoo in my brain (and then titties) \ Hang Low". It's a song about titties okay? AND WHAT A PHENOMENAL SONG IT IS! This song is all about loving the real body of the narrator's partner, and reaffirming that all of its imperfections make it unique and more desirable rather than less. In a world where a person's conformity to impossible beauty standards dictates their societal value, it's important that we also recognize the beauty of the natural appearance and acknowledge that we all age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elcock was heavily influenced by Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly to the point where he said "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.spin.com/2022/07/blk-odyssy-interview/">It changed my perspective on music</a>". It made the frontman want to "make music with impact". When you consider the genres it blends and the production for this album it all just makes sense. Shit, it even has a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9fN-8NjrvI">George Clinton</a> feature!
        </p>
        <p>
          The album continues TPAB's legacy and accomplishes Elcock's goal of wanting to make music with impact by discussing social issues throughout the whole record. One of the new tracks on THE REPRISE was COMPLEX OF KILLING A MAN. This track details the mindset around a gang-related murder but it gets it's emotional depth from BLK ODYSSEY experiencing the <a target="_blank" href="https://abc7ny.com/archive/7390971/">death of their older brother at the hands of police in 2010</a>. It details the story of a group of young men and the actions they take while running from the police. They crash in a car chase and eventually try to make an armed stand against police all in vain. The police have a domestic monopoly on violence after all, you can't stand against them individually with a glock. The companion song to this one is the outro DRINKING GOOD where the band, accompanied by long-time collaborator Eimaral Sol, details a much more intimate perspective of Elcock's emotional reaction to his brother's murder. It's own outro borrows from Jay-Z's the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/RM7lw0Ovzq0?t=44">Story of OJ</a> with "They see a light nigga, dark nigga, rich nigga, poor nigga" and then flipping it to "Run nigga, run nigga \ Hands to the sky nigga \ Freeze nigga, please nigga \ Fears in your eyes nigga" as you can imagine the fear a Black person might have when staring down the barrel of a state-issued firearm. These two tracks put a lens to Black grief that doesn't feel forced or <a target="_blank" href="https://i.redd.it/01nc7ajmrhv61.jpg">cheesy</a> but full of depth and life.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE REPRISE adds 6 brand new songs to the group's original 2021 release of BLK VINTAGE. I wonder if I had listened to the original LP if I would've liked the album so much without BENNY'S GOT A GUN and COMPLEX OF KILLING A MAN. Genuinely, I don't think it matters because I found it how I did and when I did. It's perfect in its final THE REPRISE form and THAT'S why it stands undisputed at the top of this list. 👑
