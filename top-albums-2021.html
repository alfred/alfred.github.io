        Okay, honestly? 10 albums is really hard to do. But, if I absolutely had to choose a 10th album it'd be <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLujZ9KnPnc2knaFJqiSAMThEYxvuOMWH3">Juno by Remi Wolf</a>.
      </p>

      <article id="demidevil-ashnikko" class="album">
        <h3>9. DEMIDEVIL by Ashnikko</h3>
        <p>
          DEMIDEVIL is a pop album discussing the contemporary nuances of hooking up with different kinds of people and how well or not well that goes. Overall it's a Pop album with Rock elements where Ashnikko raps sometimes. It is one of two albums on this list with top-tier musical references and samples. One notable musical homage is her flip of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIy3n2b7V9k">Avril Lavigne's Sk8r Boi</a> into her own track, L8r Boi. The second, and my favorite of the two is her sampling <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3JFwd1bk4Q">Kelis's Caught Out There</a> to make the song Deal With It. This is probably the only song where she doesn't frame herself as completely faultless. Her fault is that she punishes whoever she's currently <em>dealing with</em> by drawing dicks all over their sweatshirts instead of just breaking up with them peacefully.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first four songs on the album are such an insanely strong run in terms of lyrical content and production that sometimes I forget that it's only four songs. Daisy being a huge song and pop hit transitioning into Toxic where she actually goes OFF rapping-wise, pushing through to Deal With It with a huge Kelis sample, and rounding off with Slumber Party, an album sleeper hit featuring Princess Nokia.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are a lot of lyrics on this mixtape about sexual disappointment the album actually makes you happy to not have to deal with all the shit she goes through, or if you have in the past, that you aren't dealing with it now. In Clitoris! The Musical she gives a first-hand account of the age-old tale of the cis-gendered heterosexual man who just can't figure it out. "You've been rubbing the same spot on my leg for 10 minutes \ You haven't hit it" If I ever caused a song to be written about me with such embarrassing content, please do not tell me because I will be forced to fake my own death. Gonna just say explicitly I don't wish this kind of dating experience on anyone especially anyone reading this, and if you ARE dealing with this you need to set the bar a little higher for yourself. Good luck tho. Y'all be safe out there.

        <h3>8. Inside by Bo Burnham</h3>
        <p>
          This album came out in May 2021 right after the special dropped on Netflix. This album is a collection of songs that are part of the special and this review is mostly gonna be for the music but the visuals are worth watching! Actually, on the topic of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81289483">the visuals</a>, can you believe that this special <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Variety_Special_(Pre-Recorded)#2020s">lost the Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded)</a> to the freshly-released-on-streaming Hamilton? Genuinely a tragedy. I also wasn't a Bo Burnham fan at all prior to this special but I damn sure am one now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Musically, this album has Burnham on a keyboard and MIDI board for most of it's production, but the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjPau5QYtYs">80s musical elements</a> make me feel like we're in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taNyaV5mhko">Richard Simmons workout video</a>. This kinda makes sense because he was born in 1990, so a lot of the music he grew up on was probably made in the 80s.
        </p>
        <p>
          One central theme of the A side of this album is Burnham's self-awareness and how his own observations affect his mental health. In the songs Comedy, How The World Works, and Problematic he is honest about not really understanding his place in the world and what he can do to make things better. What's most fun about this song is that both the ways the world works as described by Bo and Socko are true. On the macro scale, something his sock puppet, Socko, tries to explain is that Burnham does not have to make some gigantic impact to make the world better or become some prolific fighter of systemic injustice to have changed things. The fight for equality does not and cannot hinge on the actions of any one person. This is true no matter whatever identity-driven axis of power where you fall onto. On the topic of white people specifically centering themselves whether intentionally or unintentionally, just please recognize that no one is looking for you specifically to solve the world's problems. Also realize no one is asking for your permission either, just cooperation. The devil doesn't need an advocate, the corporations don't need you playing their side for free. Just chill and listen to people with solutions and don't stand in their way.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we owe to each other as people with influence is actually on the micro scale. The micro actions we take and their impact, multiplied by a critical mass of people trying to make similar change happen is actually how we shift culture. So if anyone spent last year wondering "But what can I do?" I'll tell you. Go meet your neighbors. Learn what skills they have, share what skills you have, and share contact info. Create a plan together for how you will support each other <em>before</em> either of you needs support and stick to it. Commit to doing a little bit more for those in your community before you try to look outwards to communities you don't belong to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The song that had the most impact on me was Welcome To The Internet. The first time I watched this song being performed in the special, I covered myself with a blanket and asked my friend to turn it off because I was truly terrified. Bo Burnham transforms into the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/7RswZkSrAQE?t=33">devil and drags you down to hell</a> but then you listen to the lyrics and you become hyper-aware that he's just describing the current world we live in. Honestly a lot of the SPECIFIC things he listed, I've seen first-hand on the internet. Isn't that wild? For example, famous women’s feet (you can find <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVqDaS1ldu0/">taylor swift’s feet on her instagram</a> and I know this because its a meme that she does this on purpose. Don't send your bare feet on the internet for free), fights for civil rights/tweets of racial slurs (have you ever seen the replies to a prominent person's tweets?), how to build a bomb (or the <a target="_blank" href="https://defcad.com/">CAD file to 3d print a gun</a>), Obama sending immigrants to vaccinate your kids (this is just any Fox News segment), you should kill your mom (there are a lot of men on the internet trying to radicalize young men and encourage violence against women, specifically violence that will distance them from their traditional support network and have them turn to the men online as their only option), and there’s so much more he lists in the song but I'm not gonna go through every single thing right now. Listen to the song and feel how fucking OVERWHELMING it sounds when delivered this way and this is something we all experience every day for hours a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the more abstract end, "apathy's a tragedy and boredom is a crime" is such an accurate but fucked way to think about the internet and I've thought about this more than once. Like how can I be bored when I have access to the sum total of all human knowledge? That's fucked up. Then you put more pressure on yourself to find the next interesting thing. This shouldn't be our relationship to information or knowledge. My way of solving this has just been letting myself accept a little less and be happy with just enjoying the things I do enjoy. It's a slow moving process for sure but it's comforting to just let some things go.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the topic of Bo Burnham's own mental health we don't have to look that far and can just listen to songs like All Time Low, That Funny Feeling, and Look Who's Inside Again. Honestly TFF is so funny. A lot the song is social media related and obviously exaggerated but its accurate to that. The other two songs are him talking clearly about his mental health, how his panic attacks were affecting his career, working and healing through those, then translating those to the pandemic and being stuck at home again. It's not subtle or anything so I don't feel like I should spend so much time describing it to you, you can read so you can definitely sit and listen to/watch this.
        </p>
        <p>
          There isn't really a way to close this out, and I made the album sound really depressing but its fun, and has its high points too like White Woman's Instagram! I don't have an Instagram account but the song apparently was hella accurate because <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notyourmusicteacher/video/6969376226242874630">more than one white woman came out</a> saying he absolutely read them and embarrassingly went through her own grid to show every single thing he listed in the song. If a song made fun of me with this much accuracy not even water boarding would get me to admit it publicly but y'all keep doing you.

      <article id="nice-amindi" class="album">
        <h3>7. nice by amindi</h3>
        <p>
          Amindi wrote her own summaries for each song and I really don't want to paraphrase them here, but I probably won't be linking any other resources for this album besides those.
        </p>
        <p>
          This album is hyper self-critical. I don't want to say aware, because sometimes Amindi raps or sings about changes she makes as tests for herself not as decisions with certainty. She moves between singing and rapping without the listener noticing like she's trying not to disturb them, it's actually really kind. You float while you listen to this, not levitate, like a <a target="_blank" href="https://cartoonsondrugs.tumblr.com/post/643869307004125184/embed">legit cartoon pie smell float</a>. You'll go anywhere she wants to take you and you can be damn sure this project is gonna take you somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you listen to this album, you'll work with Amindi through how she hypes herself up (<a target="_blank" href="https://amindi.xyz/u-got-next">u got next</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://amindi.xyz/haircut">haircut</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://amindi.xyz/death-proof">death proof</a>), how she reflects with internal problems (<a target="_blank" href="https://amindi.xyz/great-again">great again</a>), how she pushes off external negativity (<a target="_blank" href="https://amindi.xyz/nwts">nwts</a>), and how she likes to party (<a target="_blank" href="https://amindi.xyz/telly">telly</a>). There's a lot here and it feels so unique and uncompromising. She's another artist where I definitely don't know her and I'm so proud of her and what she accomplished with this EP. It really feels like she managed to translate her feelings accurately onto the songs she released and that's all I ever hope for when I listen to music.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AM1ND1/status/1468703390624411650">haircut</a> is about self love, fairly literally. It's about feeling yourself and taking yourself out just cause <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSjM5B3QNlw">you deserve it</a>. If no one else is gonna spoil you, why shouldn't you spoil yourself? "just got my haircut told my guy to fade the sides \ got my lashes filled accentuate my eyes \ whoever said that i'm not bad they fuckin lied \ look in the mirror at myself like damn she fine". WHO AMONGST US CAN SAY THEY HAVEN'T DONE THIS? Well I can because I have naturally long beautiful lashes <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T4NDG8VNZ/feelin-myself/5bc6bc9b58384c7e.png" alt=":feelin-myself:"/> but the rest is relatable as fuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is an obvious and unrepentant Drake fan. So much so that she named a song <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Was_the_Same">nwts</a>. Nothing Was The Same is Drake's third album and home to the hit song Started From the Bottom which also happens to be a concise summary for this Amindi song. The nuance she adds is that in her case it's "Started From the Bottom AND I did it all myself". Amindi refuses to let anyone else take credit for her success.
        </p>
        <p>
          The murky party song death proof is probably my favorite song on this EP. Amindi is a “<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AM1ND1/status/1468659361517953026">rapper masquerading as an R&B girl</a>” and this track is the best example of that. "that's my bestie \ go bestie \ look real grown & sexy \ if being bad could kill a bitch, mek dem gwan arrest we". Like what kind of flex is this? I heard this and immediately ran it back because this is the energy I feel when I go out with friends. You just wanna hype each other up and enjoy yourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The song with the most emotional depth on the project is great again. It's really about feeling restless or unmotivated where you decide to make a change because you just can't shake that you don't feel fantastic. You feel stagnant. Amindi begins the song with the hook where she decides to stop smoking weed due her lack of motivation but nothing really else. "overall, i feel fine \ but i'm trynna feel great" demonstrates that she knows she needs to keep working even if she doesn't feel it. The repetitive bass line musically puts us in her shoes and makes me feel like I'm walking around my apartment aimlessly trying to accomplish <em>something</em> to get the dopamine rush that only progression can give me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't want to project too much onto her but stagnation to me feels like death. That could be some trapping of capitalism that I've internalized, but I do think that not having goals & making progress towards those goals makes me feel like I'm wasting my time, that I'm in need of a drastic change, and that I gotta shake things up. In her song, Amindi just stops smoking weed (again) cause she knows herself well enough to know that she doesn't need some drastic change, she just needs to clear her head and reignite some passion for something else. She even acknowledges that its not that serious and she'll probably start smoking again next week if her history of taking breaks is any indication. Usually a drastic change isn’t the way to deal with your problems but fuck it— in the moment it’s excruciating and you have to do something, anything to break through.

        <h3>6. Thicker Than Water by rum.gold</h3>
        <p>
          Over the summer, I took my first post-vaccine trip outside of Chicago and flew to New York for my nephew's high school graduation. Anytime I go to NY, I also make sure I visit my friends who live there so if you're reading this and live in NYC lemme know and I'll come hang the next time I'm there. This trip into the city, I stayed with Bea because she had an open room, thankfully, which was a step above my normal couch surfing strategy. One day when we were walking somewhere, a rum.gold poster on the street caught my eye, I searched for it on Spotify and then when we got back I put it on the speaker. I fell in love with it pretty much immediately and now it's on this list. I also get the added benefits of allowing myself to feel the superiority that comes from finding an up-and-coming artist before everyone else has.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intro track Follow The Light puts you in your feels right away. Rum.gold describes everything he would do for the person he loves. He's willing to put their needs above his own to the highest degree he can. The issue with that is that it's not a demonstration of an already existing love, but feels more like a petition to have <em>his</em> love reciprocated. Not a strong start to a relationship, to say the least.
        </p>
        <p>
          Niagara Falls is the successor to Follow The Light and it stays on topic. rum.gold has realized that even though he was ready to give his all for this person, they wouldn’t do the same. He’s heartbroken but has found strength in his own capacity to love. He’s content now that if this won’t work out, he doesn’t have to accept less and can move on. The ending of this song has an ethereal voice repeating “Happy being lonely” because that’s his new reality, and he’s accepted it, and is completely sure in his decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human is an EPIC. It’s also the standout song on this album measured by Spotify plays. The strings that come from rum.gold’s acoustic guitar mixed with his powerful vocals make it hard to dispute the data. His falsetto grabs me by the throat, it stops my breath, and puts me in a trance as the waves of bass between bars melt me until I'm ebbing and flowing along with the song. Every refrain of the word “Human” re-engages me in this amalgamation of body, emotions and music. The falsetto also has an incredibly overt sense of reverence. rum.gold's roots are in religion, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aq4pv/rumgold-thicker-than-water-interview">going to church every week with his mom</a>. It's impossible to escape acknowledging how much growth he must have had experienced while a part of that world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Greed is a special song because its probably the only one where he sounds happy, or rather, not completely heartbroken. That vibe is still present but it’s not the point. He’s happier here, or at least optimistic which for someone like him is all I want. It’s as close as he gets to bridging the gap between R&B and Pop. The darkness here is hidden in the beauty of the track (though obviously not the connotations of the title) á la early Weeknd because the behaviors he describes on the song go so much further than the  hedonism of simple partying. Rum.gold’s happiness is more toxic to those around him because that level of excitedness is infectious.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're looking for a summation of his style and what kinds of songs he makes look to the tracks Lullaby, How You Like It, and Thank You. I wouldn't list them individually as standouts but overall his voice is so soothing and when he stretches to his high notes I feel it in my chest. The hairs on my arms stand up. It's the reaction of chills but it's actually very warm. It’s familiar, it’s gentle, it’s kind. It’s cozy and there’s a sense of closeness in the music.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eponymous track Thicker Than Water is so aptly named. It's a big bet to name a song the same thing as your album and rum.gold hit the jackpot with this one. This is the other side of Follow The Light, like the parts where the love is just forming and you ignore the red flags and everyone is just excited and happy at the prospects of falling in love. So if Follow The Light is the peak of being crazy about a person, this Thicker Than Water is announcing every trauma that’s caused him to get into that state and how it makes him feel. It’s the precursor to a lot of pain. 🥺

        <h3>5. The House Is Burning by Isaiah Rashad</h3>
        <p>
          Isaiah Rashad is my all-time favorite rapper, so maybe I'm a little biased in having him on this list, but it's my list and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLPM-P7mNQw">I do what I want</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After his <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nehXj4SwhE-3j5kmgkKoHwiIEsAw4urpc">formal debut album</a>, he developed a drinking problem that combined with a Xanax habit and together they shredded his gut lining. The drinking and drugs were coping mechanisms for his struggles with depression and anxiety which shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who listens earnestly to his music. He had allowed his vices to grow and overpower him and was paying for it. He was no longer doing the drugs, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DY1ALFrVJU">the drugs were doing him</a>. As a testament to how much damage addiction can do to a person, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thefader.com/2021/05/06/cover-story-isaiah-rashad-after-the-fire-the-house-is-burning-interview">he spent 30 days in rehab</a>, almost got dropped from his label, TDE, and was very close to quitting rap entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rashad is the type of hometown hero who doesn't leave anyone behind and that pressure ended up acting as an accelerant to the decline of his mental health. All of his money goes to helping folks in his native Chattanooga, Tennessee. Spending money for community benefit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZm6JNjpipg">doesn't leave a lot for a flashy lifestyle</a>, but the guy still likes to party. Like a phoenix from the ashes, <em>this album</em> is a return to a better world for Rashad. If The Sun’s Tirade can be expressed as a long sunny day, this album makes me feel like I’m welcoming an old friend home after a long journey.
        </p>
        <p class="precedes-list">
          When someone who likes to party makes a grand return, you know they gotta bring the IGNORANCE. Please allow me to introduce you to just a sliver of that:

            <li>This is an upsetting line, assumingly for the person saying it and more the person receiving this news</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Yeah this is heat, no question</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          One thing Rashad doesn't have is an ego. He lets every single feature on this album shine, but I don't think he balanced it out with standout verses of his own. That doesn't mean his verses were bad or anything, it's just none of them stole the show to me. This is pretty much to be expected from him though, cooperation and collaboration over outright competition. My favorite feature is Amindi on All Herb where they give us a collaboration that I can only call a beautiful treat of a song. My most anticipated feature was Smino on Claymore. I had been waiting for the two of them to collab for so long and the song did not disappoint!
        </p>
        <p>
          The feature we all should've anticipated was SZA on Score. TDE's second class's dynamic duo have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxArFOPmjcw">never missed</a> on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWM3IUVCi3U">song together</a>. There have been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrHQka9XchA">many</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sc1YvgxlSg">opportunities</a> and they have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jid9eVXPux4">never missed</a> 🎯. As for Score, I thought 6LACK ruined it on first listen, but at this point I can't get over the song as a whole. It's become one of my favorite songs on the album.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the lead single off the album, Lay Wit Ya also became my Spotify Song of the Year. Hopefully this tells you how excited I was for this album to come out. "Big wheel got that motherfucker skatin' hard \ Chill pill got me high but can I lay wit ya? \ Last year you was my bitch, now you my baby girl".  The hook is on repeat in my head by default whenever my mind wanders. It's so classically Rashad with his unique slurred drawl-like mumble and it makes me so happy to hear him this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mumbly delivery is so characteristically him. The best example is the second verse on Hey Mista. That's the kind of Zay that I show up for. It's the distorted-but-faded consistent cadence rapping that manages to transform and pull itself back into a mellow hook. That transformation is triggered by the sound you hear when you pick up a landline while someone is connected to dial-up which is the icing on the cake. I'm honestly a bit shocked at how this doesn't feel so on-the-nose but really just appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing how bad things were going for Rashad before this album dropped, hearing him rap lines like "They say that I'm a cool cat, fuck that \ Tell them bitches I'm a top dog, get shot" really make me so relieved. Like YES YOU ARE A TOP DAWG. No one can take that away from you now but you. I don't know him personally, obviously, but I'm still so incredibly proud of him. It really would’ve been a <a target="_blank" href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLUvnqOYhdlNo4lQUeGq940LJYc4StoLKE5DycB1bFaen8RCybIgjlEY4BIDSBiF2m8ownD4WSEG8qyvLBbQqmIzO6AoCmmcDPw5hNCDe-Al02dskmuwYbfDC-DQAm409xqy6SW4ASHE_DmOYk9l6Bt7Xw=s0">personal loss</a> if I didn’t have more Isaiah Rashad music in my life and I’m so grateful he managed to get the help he needed to heal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've seen Zay three times live. Twice at the Sinclair in Boston for The Sun's Tirade tour and once in Chicago now for The House Is Burning Tour. His music arranged for a live show is an enigma. Some songs are obvious bangers like From The Garden. That's okay. Some songs oscillate between ballad and banger that causes a weird phenomena to occur in the crowd where you'll be vibing rocking back and forth and the person next to you will be jumping up and down and somehow you'll both be right. There aren't many other acts where that happens, I honestly can't even name any.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isaiah Rashad closes out the album with the duo of THIB into HB2U. He loves to get introspective and vulnerable which he does with the chorus of the former as he slowly chants <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGy4bmG5SJw">"Who's that creeping in my window? Who's that fucking with my conscience?"</a> to give us an idea of his anxiety at that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second half of HB2U is the perfect outro to this album. "This ain't the time of my life, but I'm still on drugs \ Just that weekend buzz" is just so honest. The album puts me in a trance and once it's over I become freshly aware that I traveled with him through his adventure where you aren't exactly sure where you went but your body feels the <strong>weight</strong> of it all either way. You feel heavy and fatigued but also relieved at the same time. You can physically feel that the trip wasn't easy but it was definitely fulfilling and you're so so happy you went.

        <h3>4. SOUR by Olivia Rodrigo</h3>
        <p>
          SOUR is a breakup album for everyone though widely understood to be about the breakup between Olivia Rodrigo and Joshua Basset. Why does every <a target="_blank" href="https://people.com/celebrity/zac-efron-and-vanessa-hudgens-break-up/">Troy and Gabriella date and break up</a>? Maybe it’s mirroring how most high-school romances end? I don't know, I’m not gonna get into that. I’m not the person to ask about celebrity drama, I’m just here to talk about my feelings relative to the album and what an album it is!
        </p>
        <p class="precedes-list">
          This album brings us back to the pop punk teen angst era of music. The true pop punk era is a little bit before Rodrigo's time but that doesn't stop her from channeling it so well. There are so many musical homages/references/samples on this album and almost every artist that she references has blessed and cosigned her. As a short list of some big ones:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>good 4 u incorporates Paramore's Misery Business</li>
          <li>brutal is heavily influenced by Paramore and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ElvisCostello/status/1409567943520931847">Elvis Costello</a></li>
          <li>1 step forward, 3 steps back <a target="_blank" href="https://www.insider.com/olivia-rodrigo-taylor-swift-sour-new-years-day-songwriting-credit-2021-5">has a Taylor Swift piano riff</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Olivia Rodrigo doesn't only have the blessings of artists who came before her but she also is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2022-grammys-complete-winners-nominees-nominations-list">Grammy nominated</a>. She's a shoe-in to win Best New Artist and it'd be a scam if she didn't, and while the Grammy's <em>are</em> a scam they don't normally choke on such a slam dunk. She absolutely ran the beginning half of 2021 musically.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first impression of Rodrigo came from her single drivers license. I legit had no idea <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Musical:_The_Musical:_The_Series#Cast_and_characters">who she was before</a> because I was never a Disney kid (or adult). When drivers license came out <a target="_blank" href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2021-01-01%202021-04-24&geo=US&q=%2Fg%2F11n0zdv5tp">it blew up</a>, and I saw it everywhere on social media and also in my own Spotify social feed so I ended up listening to it. On first listen I thought "Godamn! That was a song! But also, how did everyone know who this was???". Then I forgot about the song and SOUR came out, and once again it was all over social media so I put it on and right as I click to see the track list I think "Wait, why is this happening again? How am I so out of the loop? Also, whatever happened to whoever sang that drivers license song?" Right as I thought that I looked down and there it was! I've since mentally prepared myself for this happening again. If we're talking music though, the bridge on this song is ANGELIC. It's a modern hymn.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this album was a five paragraph essay and you needed a hook to engage your audience that hook would be the guitar on brutal. Immediately on my first listen, I pretty much decided no matter what followed that guitar that I was on board. It just worked out that the more I listened, the more transfixed I became. All types of guitar stay prominent across the album, in good 4 u the bass guitar during her verses and electric guitar on the hook make me feel like I'm being pulled in two different directions. It's a back and forth between leaning in, hanging on every word she says and jumping around, screaming wildly as she's sarcastically singing "good for you".
        </p>
        <p>
          Though a big focus on SOUR is Rodrigo's romantic relationship in its post-ending stages, the other big focus is on her self-esteem and self-image in comparison to other girls her age. It’s not lost on me how weird it is to talk about how a, then, 17 year old girl sees herself in relation to her peers so for the sake of keeping this review authentic (whatever that means) don't expect me to dive super deep into that. The song jealousy, jealousy explores every surface-level trait other girls have that she thinks she doesn't. We all eventually learn to sit with who we are, and Olivia is honest in not having got there yet. If <em>I'm</em> being honest I think a lot of adults never get there. I also think that writing this song and putting it out there represents a huge step in acknowledging that she's on her way to being comfortable with who she is.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's really difficult to choose standouts/favorite songs off this album because every song could be a single— no skips.

        <h3>3. Collapse In Sunbeams by Arlo Parks</h3>
        <p>
          Arlo Parks’ style is describing every single phenomenon in front of her as if she had spent years inspecting it through a microscope while recording her thoughts into a journal while constantly referencing her personal dictionary. Because of how accurately she picks her words, I have no problem visualizing her lyrics as a story but also feeling them in my heart. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beartreees/">Bea</a> was definitely the person who showed me Arlo Parks before this album dropped and I'm so happy to revisit this artist for this incredible album.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her song structure widely follows a formula where they start with an explosion of extreme emotion to grip you then mellow out on the hooks to keep you in your seat and reverently waiting for the next line delivered by her angelically soft and comforting voice. The album itself opens with a spoken word poem where she reveals and shares an intimate moment with the listener. Her gentle voice offers support without judgement but it also does not push so hard to force you to accept that support. She will let you drift under the current of her poppy production and trusts that you'll resurface when she calls out to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deep emotional depths that Parks forces us to dive straight into on the songs Hurt and Hope get you feeling really soft and exposed. She details the numbness that comes with depression while telling the story of a fictional Charlie in hurt. "Charlie drank until his eyes burned, then forgot to eat his lunch" opens Hurt in a way that doesn't allow you to look away. She then serenades us into a really raw bridge of "Wouldn't it be lovely... to feel something for once?". Parks does not let up when it comes to Hope. Hope's hook is an enchanting and reassuring "You're not alone \ Like you think you are \ We all have scars \ I know it's hard". She's the most supportive friend in the world here. She empathizes with her subject and sings to show them that. She doesn't try to debate them, she doesn't try to accuse them of faking or wanting attention, she doesn't try to fix everything. All she does is offer support as best she can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comprising the filling of the prior mentioned depression song sandwich, we have the track Too Good. This song is one of the simpler songs production-wise. It's poppy and light and has a direct message. She delivers the lines "I think you know it \ Too cool to show it \ Babe, you're so good, you're too good to be true" with genuine curiosity. She's not accusing, she's genuinely trying to figure out what's wrong with her friend and why they just can't seem to enjoy the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caroline is an excellent example of Park's storytelling. She weaves a story of a failing relationship with one partner desperately trying to hold on while they chase the other to keep them invested. They can't stand to be together anymore and have to deal with that now. They need to separate but can't get away from each other. Arlo as the narrator and observer gives life to the character chasing after his partner Caroline and gives us insight into the minds of both partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          As if we weren't having the existential time of our lives already Parks gives us Black Dog, the depression song. Arlo once again gives us a beautiful serenade on how she would support her friend with depression. This time it’s less literal and observatory, but more about the depths of how far she would go to save her friend as they slip away right in front of her. “It’s so cruel, what your mind can do for no reason” is such an apt description of mental illness that when Parks croons it all you can do is sit with yourself and listen. This song is about someone who is reaching their darkest point, and it makes you feel that to be respectful, you should give them as much space as possible to experience and work through that, tip-toe through the house if you have to. Support them in the simple ways because they can’t do that for themselves, but don’t resent them for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just Go is another upbeat track with so much sadness behind it. The perspective here of finally feeling strong enough to cut things off with a toxic partner. It can feel like a continuation of Caroline at times, but it’s so much lighter. If Caroline is from the perspective of the man begging for another chance, beating himself up about his mistakes then Just Go is a woman listing all the reasons another chance will never happen and how many chances she’s already given. She's finally free.

        <h3>2. The Melodic Blue by Baby Keem</h3>
        <p>
          Lmao I am so happy Baby Keem did not fizzle out after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3WP6g-nz4SU6zAfFC6JbZldoYYlIjfT2">DIE FOR MY BITCH</a>. This makes him the first artist in the three years I've been doing this to appear twice— and for two consecutive major releases no less! When I wrote about DFMB in 2019, I hoped that he would grow his style, mature a bit as a person and surprise us. I think Keem and I have both been validated here with the release of The Melodic Blue. His ear for production has <a target="_blank" href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/275e4a8dd3b38a80ef3daf1629e40b42/tumblr_n0v31keKTc1r5iumyo2_r1_1280.gif"><em>evolved</em></a> and it's been a long time since we've been able to witness an artist grow to such a degree in such a short amount of time. He stayed consistent in his near improvisational, say anything at anytime energy but he also mixed in more mature lyrics and a much more diverse vocabulary. He even experimented more with song structure, this album isn't all songs with 1 verse sandwiched by a long hook. It's filled with songs with multiple beat switches, flow switches and top-tier features!
        </p>
        <p class="precedes-list">
          The high points of energy on this album are fucking wild. I have to just straight list some of the most iconic standalone lines from the album as judged by me.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"If my sextape leak, your bitch on TV there, boy" - vent</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Why would you violate someone this way?</li>

          <li>"I like my women smart, I like it when they brown"  - gorgeous</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Me too, Hakeem, me too</li>
          </ul>
          <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lildmrqus/video/7021319679033527558">TWO PHONE BABY KEEM</a> - many songs</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This is one of those things I scream to myself just walking around my own house</li>
          </ul>
          <li>BIG STENCH, yes, yes, YOU BIG STENCH \ YOU BIG STENCH - durag activity</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Why would I ever need to elaborate on this?</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In Rap, the highest standard for album intro songs is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8gfqs1-NuE">Dreams and Nightmares</a> and dare I speak blasphemy, trademark usa lives up to the standard. Instead of starting slow and going hard, Keem doesn't try to replicate Meek's style— he does his own. He opens up rapping his ass off starts going hard and then GOES HARDER. Keem knows how to make an intro and the latter half sprinkles in Keem's very own personal introspective but in-your-face style.
        </p>
        <p>
          trademark usa gives way to pink panties. Honestly, I didn't like this song at first. But upon some reflection and trying to verbalize what parts didn't sit well with me I realized the west coast production coupled with the extremely vulgar lyrics was my initial turn off. I'm an east coast boy, but Baby Keem is definitely a west coast baby and probably grew up on songs that sounded just like this. This song sounds like it could’ve been on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggystyle">doggystyle</a> and produced by the late, great Nate Dogg. Obviously, it's not the exact same because it fits much better in 2021 rap than it would in 1993, but it's evident to me that era strongly influenced this song.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the keys come in on cocoa, Baby Keem announces to no one in particular "I'M BALLIN WITH MY FRIENDS". Why is he so good at openings? This song is heat the ever-present keys-adjacent sound carrying the beat kept me completely engaged the whole time. Don Toliver skates on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_PYqIZoGvo">every collab</a> and I will not be debating this. It just sucks that Toliver's own album didn't end up on this list. This song though, is almost 4 minutes of flexing on someone who doesn't appear to amount to more than a sneaky link. How did they have this much of an effect on our Baby Keem??
        </p>
        <p>
          The next song I absolutely have to talk about is family ties. This track holds the title of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6HBZC9pZHQ">Alfred's Music Video Of The Year</a>. I pretty much showed this video to everyone in my life against their will the week it came out. This is the first verse we've received from Kendrick in a long while and what a welcome gift it is. It's not often someone will invite Kendrick to feature on one track let alone two, so family ties being a single for this album had to really showcase Keem's pure rapping ability. He manages to not get washed by Kendrick and showcases multiple flows on multiple beats while giving us incredible visuals in the video as well. This is spiritually <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGLang">pgLang</a>'s inaugural track and damn it sets the bar high.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously you can't keep the energy of family ties going after and why would you want to? Baby Keem reverses course and calms down a bit and gives us scars. scars is the perfect picture of post-introspection reflection. It feels so honest but it's also very inspiring. He's thankful for what he's been through and the steady drums through the song build a confident momentum that enables you as the listener to keep pushing forward. This song makes me want to give him a hug and a blanket and tell him it'll be okay. The spiritual companion track to scars is issues. issues is even more introspective and it's another incredible example of Keem putting his feelings on display.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer I had the pleasure of attending Chicago's Lyrical Lemonade Summer Smash festival and see Baby Keem live. Luckily, I left <a target="_blank" href="https://chicago.eater.com/2021/8/27/22641197/lyrical-lemonade-summer-smash-bartenders-quit-illinois-mask-mandate-curtis-duffy-glenn-danzig">before the riots started</a>, but I did get to see the whole Baby Keem set! He was SO CUTE!! He was so happy to be there with us and kept telling us that. It was a daytime set and the crowd was expecting someone else but he still did his thing and we went absolutely <img class="emoji wild" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T4NDG8VNZ/wild/9a9d06951392250c.gif" alt=":wild:"/>. He actually rapped his songs rather than adlibbing over a backing track, which is a great sign for how seriously a rapper takes their career. I was so happy for him and was so excited I got to experience the DFMB set live prior to this album, because I hadn't yet. I really wanted to go to the Melodic Blue tour, but he had no Chicago dates unfortunately. I'm sure that means he has something else planned for us and I'm fine being patient, because he has never let me down before.

          This album also took over TikTok (which is how we assess virality now).

        <h3>1. KIDS by Noga Erez</h3>
        <p>
          It took me a long time to write the review for this album because it just sounds so good to me I can’t form coherent thoughts. Overall, it's a pop album (and I recognize how vague and frustrating that label is) that is made to appeal to a wide audience. The novelty is Noga Erez's hazy, scratchy voice combined with the electronic elements that ROUSSO adds to each track. They complement each other so well, and it's hard to say which one I love more. Erez also released an acoustic version of the album which is just as good and that made this even more difficult. Even though I say it's difficult, I haven't forgotten that the reason I write these reviews is to reflect on the year and to verbalize the emotions that were brought out of me by the the music I engaged with the most!
        </p>
        <p>
          I listen to this album when I want to listen to something comforting but hype with <em>nuance</em>. I just enjoy myself when I put it on. I just get such a level of extra energy when I’m listening to it. Every note and line screams “come and try me, I’m ready for you”. Even though it appears high energy, the album actually has some somber and heavy themes. Overall, the album approaches topics like mental health, love, social media, and long-lived political conflicts. Erez is a Tel Aviv-based artist and native of Israel, meaning that her art cannot escape the long-lived conflict between her native Israel and Palestine. This also impacts the seemingly contradictory way they talk about their feelings. They don’t seem to pull their punches when explaining how they feel but they do craft them to be palatable which may on its face sound inauthentic but I think it demonstrates how much time and care that goes into sharing their art with the widest possible audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The songs that best exemplify this well-crafted emotional expression are Cipi and Story. Cipi opens with an Erez that sounds uninterested but begins with a chanty “I’ve been deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply depressed” but the energy in the backing track as it gets layered in would make you think it’s going to be happier. This is one of those songs where that contradiction is present because even in the music <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qPAFI5NP8pM?t=42">where she explicitly notes being a pessimist</a>, there is optimism in the energy that the sound transfers.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to Story, things are a little more hazy but first off we have to talk about ROUSSO. Ori Rousso is Erez's longtime collaborator, producer and <strong>life-partner</strong>!! Y'all know how much I love a romantic musical duo if you know how I feel about Sylvan Esso. They made a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356910/">Mr. & Mrs. Smith-like</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1i-t6D0c_M">music video</a> for this song and the fight choreography makes it so fun. The song itself isn't <em>just</em> a love song though, it's a fight in that regard too but over something that just doesn't seem super important and at the end of the video they just acknowledge each other and move on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if we're talking love songs, or romantic themed songs in general one song that is absolutely not that is Switch Me Off. Erez opens it up with a smoky, smooth, cabaret intro "I got no time to fight with you my baby..." to signal that she's acknowledging that the fight has been hard and long and that she's tired. You know how for married couples they say that you shouldn’t worry when they fight but to start worrying when the fighting stops? That's the delivery of that starting line and it's served in the same tone I imagine you'd have in your final pre-divorce fight. I think the inclusion of that line in that tone is an effort to make this song palatable because it feels like the fatigue goes so much deeper. The speaker has given up their will to fight because they've decided that winning won't bring them peace. When we lose our will to fight, the fight is over. This song is sadly about the fight to live, and conversely being willing to say that the fight to live has become too tiresome, and too difficult that they'd rather have life itself switched off.
        </p>

          Up until now, I've been describing tracks that have been focused more on the individual, but Erez is also great at focusing on the big picture as well and the two songs where she does this best are Knockout and NO news on TV. The common thread between these two tracks is the artist's disappointment in what she sees when she observes of the state of the world. This has an extra layer as Erez is a Tel-Aviv native and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Israel">Israel's current government</a> is known for its increasing nationalism, Zionism, and persecution of the Palestinian people. Her public stance, as an artist who is supported by her nation (conscripted into IDF's entertainment group), is that she wishes the violence would stop and recognizes the antagonism that has been perpetuated by her own native government. She also recognizes the privilege she has in being able to live the way she does due to her success juxtaposed against the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/14/noga-erez-israel-electronic-music-off-radar-album">“extreme things happening”</a> on the Gaza strip.

          I'm writing this and realizing that a lot of the themes are very heavy and I meant to interleave the heavy with the light. That's not what's about to happen and I'm sorry for that but also not really. We have to talk about death. Prior to dropping this album, Rousso's mother passed away and they spent a lot of time with her beforehand which caused them both to face mortality and contemplate the end of life. In End of the Road, she confronts the fact that death is inevitable and the only thing she can do in life is to enjoy what time she has left. When Erez delivers "But my trip is mad. I ain't finished. I got loads." you as the listener are also forced to acknowledge that she really does have so much to offer and we been blessed with the opportunity to sit in awe of her talent.

          There's something I gotta say if I'm being honest in this entry. Noga Erez has bars.
          She can really rap for real. She demonstrates her sharp tongue with a braggy flow on the all-caps anthem, VIEWS. The song criticizes fake people, people who "buy views", or followers, or listens, or anything that inflates the value of their art. Right now, there are whole industries profiting off this fakeness but Erez, Rousso, and the featured artist, Reo Cragun, are saying indisputably that they are the best and will never need to do that. Their contemporaries can do whatever they want to tip the scales but the music speaks for itself. The triumphant brass elements on this song are the victory lap this album needs. Noga Erez is unstoppable— no matter what other artists try to do, they won't be able to catch up and THAT'S why her album reigns supreme at the top of this list. 👑
