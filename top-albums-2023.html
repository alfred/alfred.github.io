        It has become a habit. I only got 8 this year, there were definitely some runners up for 9/10 but I just didn‚Äôt connect emotionally with them to feel comfortable/justified writing about them so I left them out. They‚Äôd be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD_XQPu5mPI&list=OLAK5uy_mCXF5FUt4c4TPoKn4BMmNzdO75UEeigdw&index=1">Snow Angel by Renee Rapp</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cknp0H6P7Mo&list=OLAK5uy_mF_yUKWm6tQ1tkr6TO3pWoH1ElhbiLP64&index=1">I Told Them by Burna Boy</a> at numbers 9 and 10 respectively.

        <h3>8. UTOPIA by Travis Scott</h3>
        <p>
          Okay so, starting the tail end of the list with number 8 we have Travis Scott‚Äôs UTOPIA. People already know who Travis Scott is so I‚Äôm not going to go out of my way to explain who he is. He‚Äôs a producer, a Kardashian-Jenner baby‚Äôs father, and a rager. You as the reader probably know him as the guy who made an unnecessarily hype banger while you were in college in the 2010s and he‚Äôs been so successful at that that it could be any number of songs that popped into your head when you read that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I gotta be honest, usually when I write one of these I try to highlight how an album pushes the genre forward creatively, or on the other end of the spectrum how an album perfectly highlights all the best parts of the genre. This album... doesn‚Äôt do either of those things. It does, however, perfectly encapsulate the genre of "Travis Scott". Scott combines his digitally supplemented production with his own vocal elements to get you off your feet and float to the beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allow me to take a break from the music to address probably the biggest story of his career which coincidentally also happens to make him the Problematic Pick‚Ñ¢ of the year, so buckle up. It‚Äôd truly be wild of me not to bring up the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroworld_Festival_crowd_crush">Astroworld festival debacle</a>. Ten people died with over 300 injured as the result of an out of control crowd of festival goers became more and more rowdy. Honestly, Scott is known for loving to rage and if you‚Äôve ever been to one of his shows you know that the rage is all anyone goes to them for. They definitely got that with this fest. At around 5am, before the doors even opened, fans were lining up for the 9am festival opening. These early risers quickly turned rowdy as there were a reported 54 injures by 4pm, five hours <strong>before</strong> Travis Scott was set to perform. By the time he was on stage, the crowd was uncontrollable. Fans reported breathing issues, folks were being crushed, and eventually during Scott‚Äôs set you had an ambulance trying and failing to drive through the crowd to get <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gplvCLCVXsU">to treat the injured</a>. The aftermath was a litany of lawsuits against Travis Scott, Drake, Live Nation, Apple Music, NRG Stadium, and a whole lot more people who should‚Äôve prepared better for this event and didn‚Äôt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Travis Scott is a producer to me more than he is a melodic rapper, a la Kanye West, he can rap for sure but his strength is his understanding of instrumentals. Those one-of-a-kind instrumentals that you‚Äôll only find on a Travis Scott project help highlight the rich abundance of features on this album. This project boasts features from some of the heaviest hitters in music right now and the project is absolutely littered with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As is tradition for a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_Jack_Records">Cactus Jack</a> album, Scott shares the spotlight nearly equally with each featured artist. I say this because Scott is as much a producer as he is a frontman, so he has a lot of experience highlighting the strengths of a collaborator, even the strengths they don‚Äôt usually highlight themselves. The first embodiment of this and the first name to show up on the track list other than Scott‚Äôs is another new entry on this list, Teezo Touchdown for his performance on MODERN JAM. Teezo does a great job of blending straight into Jacques production on the outro where he fully realizes his dreams of being a rockstar who throws the mic around and wails into it. Honestly, I heard him on the outro and thought "wait, who is this??" and saw his name and everything made sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other features are not to be caught lacking in name or deed because you had a vocal heavyweight like Beyonc√© pull up on DELRESTO (ECHOES) to deliver an ethereal performance as she siren-songs a refrain of "It‚Äôs the echoes..." to start each line of the pre-chorus. Though, if we‚Äôre keeping up with the competition of who was the best guest artist, then we‚Äôd be just dishonest to not include Drake on MELTDOWN. Drake does what he does best with a diss verse targeted at what seems to be Pharrell. Who has beef with <em>Pharrell</em> of all people? The last two features I want to highlight are Sampha on MY EYES where his angelic riffing sets the stage for a smooth beat switch into some of Scott‚Äôs career-best rapping. 21 Savage shows up on TOPIA TWINS doing what <em>he</em> does best where he just flexes wealth, women, and affiliation. There are two times as many names on the rest of the track list that ring just as hard so I definitely invite you to take a listen extra close to see what folks might be experimenting with.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the hook for TOPIA TWINS, Scott exclaims with all the glee of an excited child "TWIN BITCHES! TWIN BITCHES! TWIN BITCHES HOPPIN‚Äô OUT THE JETSKIIIIII". The delivery of that line is really just <strong>different</strong>, real top of the class professional shit. The first 8 bars of Rob49 on this song are a tough listen though, but if you bookend it with Travis Scott‚Äôs near schoolboy elation about his personal watercraft and his identical copilots, you know exactly when to tune back in to enjoy the rest of the song.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weekend this album dropped, I was on Tiktok just swiping, before I had even spun the record. One video was playing the song "I KNOW ?" and it was a girl who paused the song to say "Ladies this is the song that‚Äôs going to be playing as he drives way too fast on the way home after a late night". Right after she stopped speaking she let the song play and we as the viewer hear "TELL ME, IS YOU STILL UP? \ IT‚ÄôS 5AM AND I‚ÄôM DRUNK RIGHT NOW \ TELL ME, CAN WE STILL FUCK?". She captured the feeling of fear that one might experience so well that I audibly gasped and immediately recognized her as a prophet. I‚Äôll never find that TikTok again but I will never forget her words of wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>

          Overall, the shit bangsü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Jacques did it again. Something listenable but nothing really crazy. The exact kind of thing that bros at the frat party are gonna play while they sip on their mystery punch and also the exact kind of thing the worst guy you know is gonna play at parties because he wants to change the vibe up (it‚Äôs not enough of a rager for the adderrall he snorted as a replacement for dinner) but he inevitably scares the hoes because he goes for something like FE!N instead of MELTDOWN. You can‚Äôt win ‚Äòem all. Somehow Travis Scott can, but you can‚Äôt.

        <h3>7. Chris Black Changed My Life by Portugal. The Man</h3>
        <p>
          Whew this album from Portugal. the Man is just the picture of consistency from this band. They‚Äôve been recording and releasing music for damn near 20 years and I‚Äôve been a fan for around 10. Almost all their music sounds the same: good. The band is like 8 people so they are just kinda jamming and you don‚Äôt really lose that feeling of the jam ever because everyone is always doing something. It‚Äôs not unrefined like a garage band dad jam session, they are all professionals who have been doing this for close to two decades afterall, but it still feels just as cozy. They mastered the musical not-trying but actually absolutely trying rock band performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I bet you‚Äôre wondering "Who is Chris Black?". Thankfully, the band answered that for us in their Spotify bio.
          <blockquote>
            "We lost a very dear friend of ours on May 19, 2019. It shook us to our core. Chris was one of those people who was like glue; he brought everyone together. His passing really messed with us. The band was in shambles and this record is the first time I feel I made a complete record; a complete thought about our world crumbling around us and the journey back. While it is a very personal journey, I feel like everyone has a Chris Black in their life; at least I hope that everyone has a Chris Black in their life. That one friend who has a way of making everything right and making everything fun. The one who keeps you in check when you go off course and is always there to celebrate the good times and to support you in the bad times. Chris Black Changed My Life."
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          The album opens with Heavy Games, an 8 line poem by Grammy Award winning producer, Jeff Bhasker. Since I don‚Äôt know who anyone is, I <em>also</em> had to look up Jeff Bhasker and here‚Äôs <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bhasker">his wikipedia page</a>. He‚Äôs worked with some of the biggest names in music and now I‚Äôm just finding out about him on a Portugal. the Man album. Bhasker takes his short lil opener and flips it where he maintains the melody, but changes keys and lyrics. You get <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc14x7g5_FQ">Mandela Effected</a> here since it‚Äôs 20 minutes later into the album and it‚Äôs named Time‚Äôs a Fantasy. Really obvious and in your face but a fun little bit they added into the album for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conceptually, the band has always shared their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8e1sSNsf44">political perspective</a> in their music. This album is no different and one of the clearest exhibits of that is the song Champ. The first verse opens from the perspective of a soldier who believes they are fighting a righteous war. As we hear "Killing the villain, gonna dance in the moonlight \ Injecting a spirit so pure \ Blessed in silence \ Waiting for more" we are filled with a vision of someone who is fighting for what they believe in and what they believe is just while committing acts of violence. This person feels blessed even, to be doing them in such a serene environment. As the lyrics continue they make allusions to a history of violence and the singer realizes that there is no clear end goal. It‚Äôs a senseless war and descendants of the soldier will question their own history and the foundations of that righteousness they believed to have. We realize that our narrator is unreliable and might not be the good guys in this fight. On first listen, it sounds like two different perspectives, the first being a just defender, and the second being an aware colonizer. At the end of the song we hear a very clear and very visceral "Abolish borders, abolish ICE \ Abolish all systems that keep Indigenous people from their natural vibrations \ Indigenous people, take back what‚Äôs yours!!!!". There‚Äôs no more ambiguity. The first perspective is a just defender, the second perspective is the same but a hopelessness in understanding that their adversary will fight for the sake of violence, to demonstrate power, and that in defending against them you will be trapped in a cycle of violence with them. By the end you have to remember what it is you‚Äôre fighting for and the band is making it extremely clear what‚Äôs worth fighting for.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing this band loves doing is fuck with you by giving you a song that seems happy and sing-alongy until you realize the words you‚Äôre singing along with are dark as fuck. Grim Generation has the audience lamenting their entire life with "I was born \ So bittersweet \ This grim generation \ Got a hold on me".  This isn‚Äôt even the only time they do this but the next one is a longer story, with background and context, dashing heroes, falling action and a fun resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of you might know, but I went to Lollapalooza in Chicago this year with my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/cyril.appiagyei">cousin Cyril</a>. Portugal. the Man played that festival and I was so excited to see them. So excited, that in June when Cyril and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/drug_lourd/">his girlfriend Lulu</a> were visiting DC and we were talking about who we absolutely could not miss at the festival, I brought up PtM. They had basically no familiarity with the band. That was crazy to me, especially for how much I listened to them during the Evil Friends era. I vowed that we would see them at the festival and they would be good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to the set at the festival, they played Dummy and I was so distraught that I didn‚Äôt know the song already that I forced myself to learn the hook right then and there. It seemed easy and it was perfect for a sing along and I didn‚Äôt want to be a fake fan. I learned it and was able to keep up during the last two refrains of it in the live performance and later found out that I wasn‚Äôt a fake fan it was just an unreleased track so, crisis averted. I still learned it though, I know you were wondering.
        </p>
        <p>
          This album made me realize that I‚Äôm probably going to be a Portugal the Man fan for the rest of my life and I am fully okay with that. Keep fucking around with a million instruments and nonsensical lyrics and I‚Äôll keep streaming it and make every effort to buy concert tickets. No seriously, they have really perfected this rock band shit and it really does seem like they‚Äôre just doing whatever feels right when it comes to music and it‚Äôs not every day you find people inspired to do what they love while also finding success. This band has found that sweet spot and I am rooting for them (and selfishly myself) to keep that ‚ú® feeling ‚ú® forever.

        <h3>6. JAGUAR II by Victoria Monet</h3>
        <p>
          Walk with me gang. The room is filled with smoke and your eyes attempt to adjust to the hazy, dimly lit room. You can feel your every sense <em>move</em> with the beat. You‚Äôve been looking forward to this night for weeks. You made it to the party and you‚Äôre there with 50 of your closest friends who you are somehow actually close personal friends with each and every one of. You all have one thing on your minds and that‚Äôs to have fun, the most fun, the time of your lives, and it‚Äôs really just something special when everyone is riding the same wave. No one is showing up to go hard with the drinks or other substances, y‚Äôall don‚Äôt need anything else besides good music and each other. This album has the same energy as when you go out to a pregame but end up having so much fun that you just stay there because all of your favorite people are already there. This is JAGUAR II by Victoria Monet.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is technically a debut album, though it‚Äôs obviously a sequel and Monet has been in the music business for awhile. It‚Äôs nominated for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2024-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list">Best R&B Album of 2024</a> and I really hope she gets it because for an album that‚Äôs brought me so much joy, I would hope the added accolade would help bring that same joy to a wider audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opening 4 song run is so fun. Smoke with a verse from Lucky Daye gives us a peek into one of the most supportive but also sensual smoke sessions I‚Äôve ever been an unwitting audience to. Daye gives us a tongue teaser full of slant rhymes with the pre-chorus of "Hotbox while you hit the box, top, get you to the top \ Rock, but if it's a lot, I can take it from you \ Got nothin' but that gas, pass it, then pass it back \ Cough, you don't need a mask, this that shit you smoke to". Monet counters with Smoke (Reprise) and we are truly not worthy but Victoria Monet doesn't need a reason to feed her fans. Keeping the theme from an already enjoyable opening track but add what I can only describe as "wet bass twang" to keep it sexy. We bring the energy up with Party Girls to really make sure we shake out all of that tension from the week. Wrapping up this incredible 4 song run with some 4K imagery in the bouncy track Alright. Monet flexes her ability to attract whoever she wants with "Making niggas feel a way, it‚Äôs a forte, really \ Might not even hit you when I‚Äôm in your city \ Thought you was about to get some foreplay with me? \ You won‚Äôt even get a picture of these 4K titties". Like I said, tonight is all love and all friends and then some weirdos that no one really knows had to decide to ruin the vibe by forgetting their place. Monet just had to remind them real fast by destroying their egos and we can all agree it‚Äôs deserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an effort to course correct the night, Monet lets everyone know on Cadillac that if you come correct, there won‚Äôt be any problems. The song is an homage to many different eras and genres of music and is a clear realization of the message behind "<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Oz_-VaTHpc8?si=qA3Me-epfFUAlFM1&t=17">ladies is pimps too</a>". The breakdown between the first and second verses samples <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4LVf9qdFYA">Coming From Where I‚Äôm From</a> and honestly that‚Äôs a quick and easy way for an album to get on <a target="_blank" href="https://alfred.dev/top-albums-2022#blk-vintage-blk-odyssey">this list</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monet takes a moment on the perfect night to handle a personal matter on Stop (Askin‚Äô Me 4Shyt), in as lighthearted and cordial tone she can muster, she lets a past acquaintance know how she really feels about them showing up with their hand out. "Stop askin' me for money, get your own \ I barely even just got on \ Do I look like a tree to you? \ Well, leaf me alone if I do". I'm a sucker for a homonym and the leave/leaf one she hits here cause you're thinking "what do you mean do you look like a tree?" and then she hits you with that corny ass dad joke of a line and you gotta just be embarrassed. It may finally be time to get a job and leave her alone, or at least read a book so wordplay doesn't catch you so off guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you haven‚Äôt gotten sick of this perfect night metaphor I‚Äôm trying to layer on top of this album, thanks I appreciate it. If you have, well I‚Äôm sorry that you hate me and also fun, I hope you figure that out soon. Based on the critical reception this album is getting, and my own personal enjoyment of it I am optimistic Victoria Monet is not going anywhere. We should be so lucky that she has a long and fruitful career full of intimate heights that build upon the success of this debut.

      <article id="nearly-straight-chlothegod" class="album">
        <h3>5. Nearly Straight by chlothegod</h3>
        <p>
          As the debut album of chlothegod, Nearly Straight is a message to the world that there will be many styles experimented with and the experience will be a holistic one. I found her by chance since she features on one of my favorite songs from Amindi‚Äôs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql_Q3NxSClI">album this year</a>. Her voice on this album curates a vibe that <em>carries</em> you between each note. It‚Äôs like a Saturday night at a bar that always has live music and whoever curates the acts has impeccable taste. The talent coordinator is so prescient that they should‚Äôve been a coke-fueled Motown producer in the 70s anointing the next big star. Chlo unveils her soul, presents her heart, and exhibits her talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first few tracks of this album feel like chlothegod is frontperson for a local band who does important events like inaugurations and private island events but never goes on regular tours. A high quality exclusive experience that you‚Äôd only get if you had the requisite wealth or status but this album she released for us, the masses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second track is Bless Your Heart and it is flush with big moments. She comes in early with a fun reminiscent sounding "Maybe I‚Äôve <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/xCA_8zxrXt0?si=_I4S4uj-zlUbfDNO&t=168">lost my cool</a>". The soul that underpins her voice is highlighted by the choir-like adlibs on the bridge "And let the choir say amen, <em>AMEN</em> \ I had to hear it from a friend. <em>DAMN</em>". The backup vocals are a gossip session, sermon, and heartbreak all at once while you as a listener are simultaneously sipping your tea, praising your savior, <em>and</em> ready to take a baseball bat to a windshield for her peace of mind. The pre-hook of "You know what my momma always sayyy" where she winds up to deliver the self-assured refrains of "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr-AtsnJ5Qs&t=108s">bless your heart üéµ</a>" with all the sincerity of someone <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/bVP_w1rQweE?si=gCjSRjj2b_CUyMjc&t=230">who hopes you never get off Fridays and you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later in the project we have My Bad, My Fault which is a full left turn from the beginning half of the album. We take a trip to the future comparatively. The first verse feels like she sampled the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">space invaders</a> sound track for the beat of this. THEN she takes you to church with that bridge and you‚Äôre like wait when did we get to the Lord‚Äôs House?? Wait for it, it‚Äôll all make sense at the last hook when both sounds are blended and it actually sounds really good. I hope by the time you listen to this song in full you‚Äôre as glad as I was that I stuck with it. It got weird there for a sec, but you gotta trust the Chlo process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the album she dabbles in other styles, but it really feels like she‚Äôs playing around. Not playing around like a kid would but like that one friend everyone has that‚Äôs just magically good at everything? Like they‚Äôre just having fun learning the mechanics of a new game or sport but they are naturally just above average from the beginning. It seems like she‚Äôs not willing to compromise where her creativity takes her music and I‚Äôm so glad for that because the freedom to create is what helps push newer artists forward. I‚Äôm excited to see what comes next when you consider this album feels like she is performing effortlessly at such a high level.

        <h3>4. Lahai by Sampha</h3>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm so so glad to write about English singer-songwriter Sampha‚Äôs sophomore album Lahai. I‚Äôve been a Sampha fan ever since I heard him featuring on <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/zaz4iYunbt4?si=EecDlNvtB2l_GQph&t=16">that Drake song</a> 10 years ago. A few years after that he released his debut <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGh3NNKu9eQ&list=OLAK5uy_kylXy70u_-FRaNmF6oTxpzDERUvH6GMMw&index=1">Process</a> in 2017 and if I was writing this list at that time it would‚Äôve been top 3 easily to say the absolute least. What might surprise folks about him going 2/2 for incredible albums is that his only formal music education was childhood piano lessons. So with that foundation, he is basically just some guy figuring things out and on his journey has been able to combine so many sounds into a really unique blend of just about everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadly I didn‚Äôt get to see him live during the Process tour and after that grave personal failing, I made a promise to myself that if he did ever tour again I‚Äôd make it a priority to see him. Unfortunately for me, that tour was the last time that he performed in the States. Speaking it into existence this year, I was blessed to be able to attend his Washington DC show and what a show it was. The experience was <strong><em>transcendent</em></strong>. The following week I could not stop talking about how good this show was. The whole band loves playing so much and you can tell that they‚Äôd still be playing their hearts out even if no one was watching. Phenomenal talents and I‚Äôm so glad I got to see them.

          The album itself is about family. The album traverses upwards on Sampha‚Äôs family tree to borrows <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/sampha-lahai-profile.html">its name from his grandfather</a>. Sampha himself, also shares the name Lahai but keeps it as his middle name. He found his inspiration for the project after the birth of his daughter in 2020. He was quickly overwhelmed with many philosophical questions about family while simultaneously facing the very real questions about how to build and model a family for his new little one. What some people might not know about him is that he lost both of his parents to cancer, his father in 1998 and his mother in 2015, and both losses lead him to asking questions similar to "How do you parent when you don‚Äôt have your own parents anymore?". He answers with what he‚Äôs learned on the album. Lahai is empowering, comforting and optimistic while being unwavering in the sense that Sampha wants you as a listener to know that he‚Äôs there for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sampha‚Äôs first solo release in SEVEN YEARS is Spirit 2.0. This song is also the only single for the album and it was such a commanding reintroduction. I played this on loop so much post release because it was really so nice to just hear from him. The hook offers you all of the support from many fundamental forces as Sampha chirps up with "Waves will catch you \ Light will catch you \ Love will catch you \ Spirit gon‚Äô catch you \ Faith will catch you \ Friends will catch you \ Time will catch you". It‚Äôs hard to feel like you‚Äôre alone after all of that. This song is also Sampha‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs favorite song so to say this two year old has good taste is an understatement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to write more about individual tracks in this but, they are all equally beautiful songs and I know that sounds like an excuse but hear me out! They all <em>feel</em> good. In a way that a warm blanket feels good, or a hug feels good. Whatever Sampha has learned about being a parent, you can tell that he leads with love and understanding. We can all hope that if we become parents we do the same and we can all think of times when tenderness was what was required of our own parents. It‚Äôs easy to hold onto the feelings of warmth and love this album kindles inside you and I wish more music gave us this gift so freely.

        <h3>3. i was mature for my age, but i was still a child by grouptherapy.</h3>
        <p>
          A group of child stars who are now twenty-somethings making an album titled "i was mature for my age, but i was still a child" is a little too on the nose. grouptherapy. is able to show their earnest ability and talent in a way that subverts the lack of mystery. Made up of members Jadagrace, SWIM, and TJOnline the artists build upon their years of formal entertainment training to craft one of the best releases of the year. Jadagrace got her first big role as Star in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438488/characters/nm3020026">Terminator Salvation (2009)</a> and she turned that into a major label solo music career that may have just come too soon. SWIM, aka KOI, may be recognized from his roles on TBS‚Äôs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3733589/">Are We There Yet (2010)</a> & Nickelodeon‚Äôs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3596178/">Bella and the Bulldogs (2015)</a> which indicates an acting career that was pretty long-lived. If you were a Disney kid, you might recognize TJOnline from Disney‚Äôs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1991564/characters/nm1822655">Lab Rats (2012)</a>. All of these shows were kind of after I stopped watching TV geared at kids so I wasn‚Äôt particularly attached to them but I did recognize TJOnline. After doing a bit of reseearch I think I was actually just confusing him with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1927701/">Tyler James Williams</a> who was a child star and can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxZc1gUqiz8">also rap</a>, aprops of nothing. Even though I only mentioned Jada, all of them had solo music careers before becoming a group so a lot of the songs on this project were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@grouptherapyllc/video/7253197727272783150">things that were half-finished</a> then the other two got them and changed them a LOT. The group formed because all of the members <a target="_blank" href="https://i-d.vice.com/en/article/g5pj97/grouptherapy-los-angeles-music-collective-interview-raise-it-up">just ran in the same circles</a> and started collaborating with each other. The power of networking!
        </p>
        <p>
          My literal first listen to this album I lost my fucking mind when American Psycho came on (this was me ü§Ø). SWIM goes first and I don‚Äôt feel any shame in this layup of a descriptor but he went crazy. I think if this song was just this verse it would‚Äôve banged still just as hard, that‚Äôs how good it is. I‚Äôd annotate the whole verse if this wasn‚Äôt just one small part of a very big album but to give you a little taste, here‚Äôs the frenzied rhyme scheme from an excerpt of this song:
          <blockquote>
            The <span class="rhyme-scheme--2">mo</span><span class="rhyme-scheme--1">ney</span>, I <span class="rhyme-scheme--2">don</span>‚Äôt <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">nee</span>d it but I got it, <span class="rhyme-scheme--2">fu</span>ck it, I‚Äô<span class="rhyme-scheme--2">ma</span> <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">keep</span> it <br/>
            I‚Äô<span class="rhyme-scheme--2">ma</span> get <span class="rhyme-scheme--3">tha</span>t shit to <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">Kei</span>sha, I‚Äô<span class="rhyme-scheme--2">ma</span> <span class="rhyme-scheme--3">ma</span>ke it <span class="rhyme-scheme--3">ba</span>ck a <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">wee</span>k, it‚Äôs <span class="rhyme-scheme--3">tha</span>t <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">eas</span>y <br/>
            <span class="rhyme-scheme--2">I ne</span>ver <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">peep</span>ed my <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">pea</span>k or <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">spea</span>k to <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">de</span><span class="rhyme-scheme--2">mons</span> <br/>
            I <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">see</span> the <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">key</span>, the <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">rea</span>ch has got <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">me</span> <span class="rhyme-scheme--1">screa</span>min‚Äô <br/>
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, like I said, SWIM‚Äôs verse could‚Äôve easily been the only verse to make a great song and if it would‚Äôve if not for TJOnline writing a verse that demands the anchor of the song.
        </p>
        <p>
          <blockquote>
            I hate niggas ‚Äòcause the niggas hate me right on back <br/>
            I hate hoes ‚Äôcause they never wanna see me relax <br/>
            And it‚Äôs not a hoe in the sense of havin‚Äô a pussy <br/>
            But tryna pull the pussy out of me, tryna challenge me <br/>
            Women violate me ‚Äòcause I dabble in the f*ggotry <br/>
            Niggas violate me ‚Äôcause I‚Äôm happy shit‚Äôs a tragedy<br/>
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I gotta say I personally hate it when rappers use the word "pussy". It‚Äôs grating and tough to really make it work. Like truly, in my opinion even <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Zg165-mZ7x8?si=CISkLK6wEkBVUb-Q&t=79">this verse</a> is grating but he ends up making it work, which is not something he always manages. Next, these few bars are an <em>*ahem*</em> INSANE thing to rap like by content <em>and</em> by technical rapping ability. Run that shit back cause y‚Äôall not really hearing him. He‚Äôs speaking about internalized toxic masculinity in women that causes them to hold biphobic biases against him and how those impact him <em>while also</em> talking about bottoming for men. A king, a queen, an icon. Just <img class="emoji" src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0115TJHVUY/chefs_kiss/cc8359647c55d9ad.png">. Pushing the bisexual agenda one rhyme at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay so this group has a third person and that‚Äôs Jadagrace. Don‚Äôt be shocked that she can keep up with the boys just as well. She is a FORCE. She sings most of the hooks and adds a necessary break between the two other members who primarily rap. She handles business on the song how i‚Äôm feeling but really shines in club song :( where she guides TJOnline through a vocal exercise in yearning. I‚Äôve talked a lot about her singing but don‚Äôt think she can‚Äôt compete with the boys because she absolutely can and you can hear it on their lunchtime cypher DYSBF!. As is tradition, they each are present on the hook but SWIM goes first, to set the tone, TJOnline follows up, but by the time Jada is rapping the hook means a lot more as the energy from the boys chanting "do yo shit best friend, do yo shit" is <em>felt</em>. Just to flex she raps "Really I'm playin' around \ Yo nigga dig me, he stay in the ground \ They treat your girl like I play in The Crown \ Call up the block and they layin' you down", effortlessly offering wordplay describing her desirability, her status as a star, and her status to the common man.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love this group. They toured and opened for tobi lou this year, but I was holding out hope that they‚Äôd do their own headline tour so I could see them at a more intimate venue. That‚Äôs still tbd as of now but they‚Äôre doing a <a target="_blank" href="https://tickets.spotify.com/events/grouptherapy-brooklyn">show in Brooklyn</a> in February so maybe that‚Äôs a proof of concept for a new tour set. This album goes so many different directions and they do so many different styles, I can‚Äôt wait to see what things look like as they get more resources to really experiment and refine their sound as a group and as individuals. The talent here is just unreal.

        <h3>2. How Do You Sleep At Night? by Teezo Touchdown</h3>
        <p>
          The debut album from rap-rockstar Teezo Touchdown "How Do You Sleep At Night?" brings to the forefront its creator‚Äôs energy. The album isn‚Äôt just one thing and Teezo is the kind of person who can fit many roles. I call him a rap-rockstar because he talks over a melody but also has drums and guitars that crash into each other passionately. Touchdown (I think its funny to use Touchdown as his last name, like lol Mr. Touchdown) himself calls his genre <a target="_blank" href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/eric-skelton/teezo-touchdown-debut-album-2023">Rock and Boom</a> and explains it as "R&B with the intensity of rock". He has so many clear influences in rock and the abundance of guitar isn‚Äôt shying away from that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teezo Touchdown is a 31 year old <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygHB4x1OsGk">Beaumont, Texas</a> native with a unique style. He‚Äôs legit a weirdo. Most of the time you will see him with nails woven into his locks or nails woven together as jewelry complemented only by his football pads and black nail polish and a pad of sticky notes. The sticky notes can be found all over his <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TeezoTouchdown/media">social media</a>, but to him it‚Äôs a form of realizing his goals. He uses the sticky notes as a personalized record of successes but also as a written form of manifesting the things he wants for himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I commented on a TikTok a few months ago where someone listed their top albums of the year and left out this album. Some random person commented and said "no one is listening to that Disney Channel ass music" and I didn‚Äôt respond cause that‚Äôs aggressive as hell for no reason but also ok guess its not for this random. Little did I know that Teezo had a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv9u4b6rtx7">Drake co-sign</a> and in response that‚Äôs what people were saying about it but in a derogatory sense. It‚Äôs weird cause like a song being a Disney song isn‚Äôt bad, they‚Äôre made for mass appeal and high marketability. Even Teezo realized that insult doesn‚Äôt really mean what those commenters thought when he says "Well, a Disney song isn't bad. I'd love to have a Disney song". After accumulating a Drake shout out, Teezo Touchdown also <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus_Tour">just finished a tour with Travis Scott</a> which we can add to the list of artists recognizing the up and coming talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if we‚Äôre talking songs that could be Disney songs we gotta mention UUHH. It is thinly-veiled inappropriate subject matter getting marketed to the mainstream and that mainstream includes kids. There‚Äôs precedent for that and exhibit A is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/kids-choice-awards-2016-complete-867457/favorite-animated-movie-2/">the Weeknd getting nominated for a Kids Choice Award</a> for a song about cocaine. UUHH is the spiritual successor to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7trrhv">Make Me Wanna Ungh by Pretty Boy Flizzy</a>. It‚Äôs a sex song okay? The song is him asking for consent, explaining what he‚Äôs about to do to his partner, what he thinks is going through her head as he‚Äôs <em>working</em> and even describes the aftercare. Don‚Äôt think too hard about this one while you listen to the song, trust me it‚Äôs a good song but damn dude, let‚Äôs try to get back to metaphors for a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teezo has also mastered the art of storytelling. On Neighborhood he weaves a tale around a group of neighbors with different outlooks, lifestyles and backgrounds who only interact with each other in passing but all make critical changes in each others lives. The first verse follows Neighbor A who is really being intentional about building a <em>home</em> for themselves, one that they love with a garden where they grow peaches. This person even took the TV out of their bedroom so they could get better sleep by not spending a bunch of extra time with it on while in bed. Neighbor A waves at their neighbor but the neighbor doesn‚Äôt wave back and they think "what‚Äôs their problem?" but doesn‚Äôt dwell on it. Neighbor A gets a knock on the door but isn‚Äôt expecting company and still goes to answer with a light heart and curiosity. The second verse is from the point of view of someone who is really not doing well at all. They‚Äôre eating out, not doing the dishes, and don‚Äôt really have any intentions of taking care of themselves. This is Neighbor B. They‚Äôre unhappy but they don‚Äôt see any way for themselves to fix their situation even though it is seemingly entirely in their power to do so. I say that because they were able to install a gate for their dog to run around unleashed, but are not able to do things for themselves. They also seem pretty antisocial, they don‚Äôt wave back when their neighbor waves and they respond to a knock on their door by picking up their gun on the way to answer. Our last community member is really down on their luck. Neighbor C seems to be unhoused and begging for money for food and unable to take care of their basic hygiene. It‚Äôs hinted that this person is an addict as their family has moved on without them. They learn their daughter and her mother have moved in with a new man and he has a house with a gate not too far from where Neighbor C is. Our unlucky neighbor is optimistic that if they can just see their family, things will change. They knock on the door of the first house, are referred to the second house with a brand new gate. They‚Äôre nervous because they might be seeing their family for the first time in a long time. The story ends here with some expository remarks from bystanders who say that they heard gunshots. I think I did a pretty good job here for telling you the story without a beat and rhyme, so if you still have questions listen to the song or like draw a flowchart out for yourself, I don‚Äôt know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually artists are only strong in one aspect of songwriting but Teezo has storytelling <strong>and</strong> punchlines! On You Thought, Touchdown flexes his ability to lament on the actions of a past partner with a slew of descriptions around her behavior. "You would've thought she was a racer, the way she speedin' \ You would've thought that I was far away, the way she keeps reachin' \ You would've thought that I was far away, the way she keeps screamin' \ You would've thought she caught me cheating, how fast she's leavin' \ You would've thought that we was movin' how fast she's packin' \ You would've thought someone yelled 'ACTION!' with how you're actin' \ You would've thought we were in Aspen how cold your ass been \ I would've thought that we could talk about whatever happened". I love this song because it is punch line after punch line and they are all relevant to a relationship that fully has broken down. This is the kind of overthinking you can easily fall into after a breakup, or even after an explosive fight with someone you love. You felt on top of the world and like this person understood you so well and now all you‚Äôre left with is thinking that you were living in a fantasy world and fooling yourself into thinking that nothing could touch y‚Äôall. Your heart is in your throat and you're spiraling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teezo Touchdown‚Äôs artistry centers around three pillars. The first is hospitality, he tries to make sure everyone is comfortable when they come around him and that everyone is taken care of. The next pillar is professionalism, he‚Äôs respectful, on time, and practices his own form of self-discipline. Lastly, Teezo loves what he does. He really does it for the love of the game and of course he wants to blow up, but he‚Äôd still be doing it anyways. The album is a great example of those three pillars put to sheet music, he distills his sound down to a work that features and creates space for so many different artists to share their own love of creating in a way that creates something that is bigger than the sum of its parts.

        <h3>1. FORWARD by Jordan Ward</h3>
        <p>
          The Best Album of 2023 arrives in the form of debut from St. Louis native, Jordan Ward. This album came out in March and I fell for it instantly. I‚Äôve known it would make an appearance on this list since then, but damn I didn‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôd be number one at the time! There‚Äôs such good staying power on this one and I‚Äôm glad I stumbled upon it. The genre is definitely mostly alternative R&B but that‚Äôs such a broad genre I feel bad even putting it in that box. I‚Äôm sure he won‚Äôt be too upset with me though. Ward acknowledges Smino as a huge musical influence as the latter is also a St. Louis artist from the class before him. Smino nods back by enlisting Ward for the <a target="_blank" href="https://luvis4ever.com/">Luv is 4 Ever Tour</a> as an opener.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jordan Ward made this album to dance to and it‚Äôs as simple as that. On FAMJAM4000 he gives you a tune to <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Bt9v3_DbLHw?si=6CSgwyQCi72WDSJo&t=75">slide out in your socks to</a>. Ward sings "Can we bring the love back? I know that you been waiting so long for me to come home again." in the same nostalgic way that songs from the 90s warm you up to move your feet. It‚Äôs an invitation to let go of some of the anxiety that you‚Äôve been holding onto and let loose! Speaking of letting loose, the track made for letting those limbs fly like no one is watching is DANCE MACHINE. With a name like that, there‚Äôs no ambiguity here just feel it and enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was lucky enough to see him live during his Tourward ‚Äô23 tour this spring and he is very cute. He is so grateful and outwardly thankful for his success and really gives it his absolute all for his performances. My local show was at the <a target="_blank" href="https://songbyrddc.com/">Songbyrd in DC</a> which is basically a one room with a stage and a bar and a kitchen that no one should ever order from. I really really can‚Äôt say enough good things about this performance he sounds pretty similar to the recording except the energy he puts into singing is as if every show will be his last performance. Really the epitome of leaving it all on the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          He does his own fair share of singing on this album and I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and lie to you like he‚Äôs a conventionally amazing vocalist. He‚Äôs not a <em>bad</em> singer though, his style of singing is unique to him and is pleasing and satisfying to me, but yeah he‚Äôs not (just as a random example) going <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Qd_i5AukPFw?si=q9CRoqdqEaSPY36b&t=57">toe-to-toe with Jennifer Hudson</a>. Ward chirps along on 311 and sets the tone for Gwen Bunn to get involved and add her own flavor to a beautiful lullaby of an instrumental. He serenades us on WHITE CROCS as his voice quivers while he delivers "Expensive taste, these girls got expensiveeee taste". His voice almost cracks on the hook for this song and the engineer left it in for the same reason I love hearing him sing, his authenticity. It shows a much more vulnerable side that goes super well with the insecurity of not being able to provide all the material desires of a baddie.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don‚Äôt want to spend a ton of time shitting on the singing ability of my number one spot so I gotta balance it out by talking about his good singing. Taking advantage of a little autotune on FLIGHTS he <strong>soars</strong>. The record where I think his singing really excels is THINK TWICE. He details the realities that someone raised in a city with a high rate of violence might have to face as he gives us a bluesy "And yeah, I‚Äôm a fighter, but I don‚Äôt wanna fight \ Still you could lose your life, being a nice guy \ And so I take these precautions, I can‚Äôt think twice". This is one of my favorite songs on the album for the high notes he hits during the hook. Like the note on the "i" in life gives me SHIVERS!
        </p>
        <p>
          A CHERIMOYA is a fruit. It‚Äôs a treat as a fruit and also as one of the best songs on this album. Can you say ‚ú®bonus track‚ú® ? I don‚Äôt have anything else to say, just listen to it and if you don‚Äôt like it you probably won‚Äôt like half this album.
        </p>
        <p>
          During IDC, Ward deals with a breakup. On the first verse he takes the "charge it to the game" approach and he‚Äôs so clearly in denial. "I don‚Äôt care, I just want you to know \ I don‚Äôt like what you did, that shit hurt \ I don‚Äôt care what you do, anymore". He‚Äôs hurt and is secure enough to admit that, but also is trying to fool himself into thinking that he‚Äôs over it. As we enjoy the second verse we hear "She just wanna go where I go \ She just wanna take my soul \ That‚Äôs crazy \ Bad lil bitch wanna have my baby" and learn that Ward has found a new girl and she‚Äôs obsessed with him. He has also learned that there are always going to be women who want him for his money and status.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on this album, Jordan Ward has lived a long life at the ripe old age of 28 but still hasn‚Äôt lost the optimism he held as a young person growing up in St. Louis. His ability to love himself, be grateful for all of the opportunities he‚Äôs had, and his ceaseless pursuit of growth is what sets him apart from everyone else this year and THAT‚ÄôS why his album lords supremely at the top of this list. üëë
