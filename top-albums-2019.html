        <h3>10. WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? by Billie Eilish</h3>
        <p>
          First and foremost, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finneas_O'Connell" target="_blank">Billie Eilish’s brother</a> is credited as a writer on many of her songs and he is really the brains behind her music, that being said him giving her the scaffolding does not and cannot erase her talent as a vocalist or performer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Billie’s personality is displayed all over the album, with the Office skits and outros and the InvisAlign lisp skit to start it all off. This comes back for better or worse later on in the album continuing with the lead single bad guy where she paints herself as the type of girl to ruin your life but with the classic “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog" target="_blank">why would you expect anything else</a>”. The negatives show up in “wish u were gay” where billie has an unrequited love and she wishes he was gay because him not being interested in <em>any</em> women is easier for her to accept than him just not being interested in <em>her</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The album also touches on themes of death and dying. It’s worth noting that billie is good friends with the newest wave of Miami rappers and XXXTENTACION’s death did have an impact on her. She’s no stranger to these things in her real life and you can feel it on songs like bury a friend and ilomilo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I liked the album enough to put it on this list, but I do have problems with her as a person and artist. This is my Problematic Pick™ because of wish u were gay mostly but also, less important, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWsxBTE6kV4&feature=youtu.be&t=98" target="_blank">she doesn’t know what an oxford comma is</a>, and I’m not an elitist, she just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ATPhkVWi0" target="_blank">sings about it a lot.</a>

        <h3>9. Future Hndrxx Presents: The WZRD by Future</h3>
        <p>
          Coming off a relatively quiet, but not uneventful year (which included featuring on songs with Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé) Future drops a 20 song album damn near at the top of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          This album is everything people like Future for and then some. He embodies his unique toxically masculine sad boy persona so well on songs like Overdose and Ain’t Coming Back. He also just obnoxiously flexes on his listeners, haters, and fans on songs like Krazy but True, and Stick to the Models-- Future made more money than many NBA players last year and he wants you to know it. If you have ever liked a song that Future has made, there is a song on this album that you’ll enjoy.

        <h3>8. Revenge of the Dreamers 3 - Dreamville</h3>
        <p>
          This album was a collaboration album born out of the mind of J. Cole. I watched the documentary so I can say this, the idea is “Let’s get all our guys, and invite everyone else we are even kinda sorta cool with, and just make some fucking music and at the end release it as a collaborative project that everyone can be proud of”. Thus, the Dreamville sessions were born.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is so fun. There’s so many tracks where you look at the features list and think “how the fuck did they get these people in a room together”. Everyone simultaneously channels their cooperative and competitive sides to give us an album of friends competing to stand out, show off, and lift each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s primarily a rap/hip-hop album, but there are a few R&B tracks respecting the talents of the many singing rappers (and Buddy is everywhere).

        <h3>7. Shea Butter Baby - Ari Lennox</h3>
        <p>
          The new Queen of Soul, Ari Lennox, in her limitless garbanzo-bean loving wisdom has graced us with an album about independence and individualism. The themes of this album are self-reliance, learning to love yourself, learning to love others, learning to be honest about your wants/needs, and coming to terms with success.
        </p>
        <p>
          She channels so many before her in this album in songs like BMO where she harmonizes and sounds like a really overtly sexual Destiny’s Child. In her song New Apartment, she has a jazzy ensemble backing her vocals about the endless possibilities that come with moving into your own place for the first time. She also runs laps around her duet partners and Dreamville collaborators JID and J. Cole who themselves are known for running laps around their peers. It’s Ari’s world on this album and no one is going to hold her back.

        <h3>6. IGOR - Tyler The Creator</h3>
        <p>
          Okay so to me this album just felt like Tyler was pissed he didn’t win the Grammy for Flower Boy so he was like, “alright fuck it, ill make something they CANNOT deny” like GKMC -&gt; TPAB shit. Then they put him in the Hip-hop category for a pop/R&B album, but that’s a story for another day.
        </p>
        <p>
          IGOR has this kind of grainy vibe to it. It makes me feel the same way when I’m looking at something with my glasses fogged up. I just felt like any time I was listening clearly, I’d get more confused… but I was into it. Just letting Tyler hold the reigns and going wherever he lead me was really calming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The song that hit me the hardest was ARE WE STILL FRIENDS, because we’ve all had that thought before. Especially in our age range, people naturally grow apart, and where you have to keep making new friends. It’s tough to ask and evaluate who of your friends have actually drifted versus those who still hold you dear but just got busy. It takes a long time to be alright thinking about that, and I think Tyler has got that far.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dunno this one was rushed, I just like this album. Saw him at TD and it was good even though there were many children there.

        <h3>5. DIE FOR MY BITCH - BABY KEEM</h3>
        <p>
          There is literally nothing I can say that adequately represents the message of DFMB or how I feel about Baby Keem but I’m gonna try. He’s 18 and goes off the top mostly, but also says such outlandish/audacious bars that you really think he’s either really fucking stupid, or really fucking smart, no in-between. I think largely in cases where there’s no in-between we lean towards the “fucking stupid” but this guy’s 18. I don’t feel comfortable labeling someone with this much musical ability, coming off a nationwide tour as anything less than talented.
        </p>
        <p>
          He traverses so many fucking genres in this album it’s absurd. He raps a confident, but reserved reflection over an acoustic guitar on MY EX, that subtly transforms into raw emotion about the failure of the relationship. His influences cross, emo rock, trap, and other low-key cultural topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe he’ll fizzle out, but on this album he knew what he was doing. Every bar even if not meticulously calculated, must have been improvised and thrown on without any care. I just feel like he must only do things to the extreme. I note his age a bunch in this because immaturity definitely is present in his writing style and song composition.

        <h3>4. Everything’s For Sale - Boogie</h3>
        <p>
          Boogie is a unicorn in rap, explicitly because he is a contemporary Shady Records signee. One of the few members of the label to ever make it anywhere out of Eminem’s shadow and to be able to rap on a song with him and not get eclipsed, without trying to sound like him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boogie raps about co-parenting his son, being homeless, having support and also not having support from his family and friends. He is also fairly young, so with fame and money from rap come the trials of having to decide who is really with you, and who is with you <strong>for now</strong>. He also just knows what it’s like to want to get fucked up and have a good time.

        <h3>3. The Jungle Is The Only Way Out by Mereba</h3>
        <p>
          I have to admit, it took me longer than I am proud of to see the beauty in this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          This album makes me feel like I’m sitting in a dark room. Like real darkness, nothing discernible around you, and the only sound you can gear is Mereba’s disembodied voice singing to you, trying to will you to move, to fight, to feel. It’s really empowering and sad at the same time (Maybe I feel this way because of <a href="https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/600x600/https://images.genius.com/e1d96da1cc682b39363ee68c05fc4452.1000x1000x1.jpg" target="_blank">the album cover,</a> but ehh).
        </p>
        <p>
          The music combines so many soft sad songs that build to powerful crescendos it makes you want to reach out and hold those dear to you, but gently as to not hurt them or make too much of an imprint of yourself because you too, are also fragile and fleeting. Then you wake up and realize that the love was the goal all along and are happy again.

        <h3>2. Assume Form by James Blake</h3>
        <p>
          James Blake is a hiphophead who dates <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesblake/status/1181270156959457281" target="_blank">Jamila Jamil</a> and honestly we stan on these two facts alone. He is also good at music too I guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gets help from Metro Boomin on more than one track and they mesh together much better than you’d expect two artists who usually eclipse their collaborators, especially on a track like Miles High (also featuring Travis Scott). He manages to recruit the reclusive Andre 3000 for a verse on Where’s The Catch? where the rapper GOES OFF about his current outlook on his own life, giving his own take on waiting for the other shoe to drop on a career of successes and victories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can’t Believe The Way We Flow / Power On are together my favorite love song of the year, please listen to them, with the knowledge (or just whimsical thought) that he’s serenading his actual girlfriend. He also does a fucking duet with Moses Sumney what the fuck it’s so good. This album has such a mish-mash of Electronic/Dance/Hip-Hop styles I just love how no one else is making music like he does.

        <h3>1. The Lost Boy by YBN Cordae</h3>
        <p>
          Album Of The Year!!
        </p>
        <p>
          This album is so impressive to me, because while Cordae has been in the music scene for a few years, this was his debut album. He managed, purely on clout and talent, to recruit big names such as Chance The Rapper, Pusha T, Anderson .Paak and Ty Dolla $ign to feature on this album. The fact that stands out the most is that in each song where he is put up against or next to a more established artist, Cordae manages to hold his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          His raw talent aside, you can <em>feel</em> that he believes and has lived through the things he raps about. The warmth of family on songs like Thanksgiving, and the problems that come with it on Family Matters. The aggression and energy on songs like Broke as Fuck and RNP. He goes from sad but hopeful to grimy and real in a matter of a few songs.
